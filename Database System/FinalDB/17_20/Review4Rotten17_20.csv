1,20170001,Gerwig deftly mines the family dynamics for laughs and emotion; sometimes in the same scene.
2,20170001,Oscar-worthy performances; outstanding direction; great script (so real; raw and emotional) along with tremendous editing...
3,20170001,I am awfully fond of it. This film isn't for me; but it doesn't have to be. Someone out there is going to see this film for the first time. Its heartfelt; goofy; and ever-so-slightly twee wavelength will seem to be made just for them...
4,20170001,A stupendously acted and immeasurably poignant ode to the realistic bonds and barbs of life as a high school senior.
5,20170001,Gerwig shows no hesitation over putting her character in unflattering situations. The laughs come hard; they come often; and they come from all directions.
6,20170001,Marion and Lady Bird's bond is very real; strong; and complicated like many mother-daughter bonds tend to be.
7,20170001,Writer-director Gerwig manages brilliantly the delicate feat of portraying the vulnerabilities and eccentricities of the townsfolk without patronising them.
8,20170001,If Gerwig is capable of all this in her first solo feature; who knows what feats of woodwork she'll craft for us next.
9,20170001,A gloriously funny and wistfully autobiographical coming-of-age comedy.
10,20170001,Gerwig's deft handling of script; camera and actors is all the more impressive given that this is her first film as solo director.
11,20170001,Like many wonderful actresses with a gift for words (think Julie Delpy; Sarah Polley and Lake Bell) Gerwig has slipped behind the camera to create something quietly political.
12,20170001,As teen movies go; it's supremely sophisticated; capturing and crystallising that moment in adolescence when it seems that life is at last about to start and the only place you want to be is elsewhere.
13,20170002,Get Out isn't a great film because of its excellent pacing; strongly defined characters; and mastery of tone. It's a great film because it never loses sight of its concept.
14,20170002,It's tense; angry; hilarious; and here in Trump's America; it might as well be a protest film.
15,20170002,Jordan Peele takes us on a frustrating yet ultimately victorious ride with his race-based mystery horror movie. Get Out combines genuine thrills with a no-holds-barred critique of black-white relations.
16,20170002,Get Out is so damn smart; funny; and impressively directed by Peele; who embraces certain great horror tropes; but never forgetting that the best horror and sci-fi often includes clandestine messages and commentary on modern society.
17,20170002,I liked it for what it was... I was entertained.
18,20170002,I did think it was very interesting and I'm excited for Jordan Peele to make more movies.
19,20170002,By focusing the storyline on a particular form of racism -- the kind that's often disguised as peculiar envy -- Get Out reveals something more insidious.
20,20170002,It's Guess Who's Coming to Dinner made over in the spirit of Rosemary's Baby; with accessories inspired by Meet the Fockers.
21,20170002,It's a game-changer.
22,20170002,Kudos to Peele for tackling a painful subject in such a massively entertaining and thoroughly memorable fashion. [Full review in Japanese]
23,20170002,This brilliantly provocative first feature from comic turned writer-director Jordan Peele proves that the best way to get satire to a mass audience is to call it horror.
24,20170002,Peele seduces; subverts and manipulates audience expectations - as the masters Alfred Hitchcock; John Carpenter; and Stanley Kubrick did before him.
25,20170003,At least; finally the DCCU seems willing to learn from its mistakes and improve over previous entries.
26,20170003,Wonder Woman stands proudly on its own; and a frankly astonishing sequence of Diana crossing No Man's Land alone pushes a fun blockbuster directly into iconic territory.
27,20170003,... the directing by Patty Jenkins who shows that she can take a good script and turn out great scenes and coherence. Her way of directing works fantastically well with lead Gal Gadot's interpretation of Wonder Woman.
28,20170003,Judged on equal footing as all other superhero films; as it and all movies should be; this is a terrific action film; a sly take on gender politics of the early 1900s; and a wonderfully crafted antiwar picture.
29,20170003,Part of what I really liked about this movie was that it focused on her as a character and a human being.
30,20170003,It was totally entertaining. I'm excited to see more of these movies.
31,20170003,Wonder Woman embraces issues of female power and the need to turn from hate to love; war to peace in a mainstream delivery system. And the female lead is not solely a mother; sister; girlfriend or hooker; however gold her heart: wonder of wonders!
32,20170003,The final big action sequence; as now seems always to be the case; is a messy and overwrought CGI extravaganza. But at least the movie that precedes it involves actual characters-likeable ones; even!-exhibiting recognizable human emotions.
33,20170003,Jenkins tries not only to include men on Wonder Woman's side but also to make male viewers feel better about a woman saving them.
34,20170003,Beauty; strength; goodness; bravery: These are your values; and here is how your values must look.
35,20170003,"""Wonder Woman"" is a superhero movie; and it fulfills the heroic and mythic demands of that genre; but it's also an entry in the genre of wisdom literature that shares hard-won insights and long-pondered paradoxes of the past with a sincere intimacy."
36,20170003,As befitting the genre; Wonder Woman is heroic and spirited. The fighting sequences are spectacular; and the story is engrossing; uplifting and fun. There's even a bit of romance and humor amid all the action. [Full review in Japanese]
37,20170004,"With a dedication to excellent ""show don't tell"" presentation; stunning cinematography and a downright scary soundtrack and score; Dunkirk succeeds at putting viewers in the thick of an unsung but no less dark time of the Second World War."
38,20170004,[O]ne of the most captivating and compelling films of the year so far.
39,20170004,By bringing Dunkirk in at a brisk (for him) 106 minutes; Nolan rediscovers his gift for concision that made his early gems like Memento so pleasing.
40,20170004,There is nothing clinical about it; just good old-fashioned elbow grease filmmaking. Sometimes; it's all it takes.
41,20170004,The marriage of performance; sound; structure; and downright astonishing visuals makes Dunkirk the ultimate moviegoing experience.
42,20170004,As a technical achievement; I'd certainly give the framework high praise; but as an instrument in delivering high drama; I'm less than convinced. This is still very much a recommendation.
43,20170004,Occasional bursts of flames; imperiling many of the effectively nameless characters; come as a relief from the chromatic tedium.
44,20170004,"""Virtual reality without the headset""; [Nolan] calls it; and it's no idle boast. Everything has been meticulously -- and effectively -- designed to dissolve the barrier between you and the screen."
45,20170004,It isn't a standard war movie; but it sure is some beautiful; difficult thing.
46,20170004,Nolan's sense of memory and of history is as flattened-out and untroubled as his sense of psychology and of character.
47,20170004,Few films have stripped war down to its terrifying; thrilling essence as Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk; and few films have turned war into such an overwhelming; almost physical experience.
48,20170004,Masterful visual storytelling on an epic scale.
49,20170005,The music is enchanting; the visuals are stunning; and the overall family theme will have your family appreciating traditions; roots and a desire to create even more memories.
50,20170005,Coco may be run-of-the-mill Pixar; but any movie that sticks it to certain notorious anti-Mexican deserves my respect.
51,20170005,A sweeping; lovingly detailed epic of sorts that benefits from its unique setting and Latin-American soundtrack.
52,20170005,This movie was emotional.
53,20170005,I really liked the music. That was my favorite part.
54,20170005,Rich; colorful and utterly inspired.
55,20170005,Every plot point and thematic implication slots into place; but the pleasures of Coco are above all visual. I don't think I've ever seen a computer-animated film so rich in detail; or so dedicated to recreating complex and beautiful lighting schemes.
56,20170005,Not top-tier Pixar. But decent enough.
57,20170005,... Coco is another triumph for Pixar...
58,20170005,This is a charming and very memorable film.
59,20170005,Funny; irreverent and eye-popping. It will also make you want to cry at least once but possibly as many as three times.
60,20170005,At worst it suggests that the brains trust at Pixar; after 22 years of peerless output (Toy Story was 1995); is finally eating itself. At best; well; it's a superbly polished; technically flawless family film that makes you cry. And this is bad how?
61,20170006,This is a elegantly portrayed love story set against a shifting background that leaves you wanting to see more happy endings.
62,20170006,The Shape of Water's visual; acoustic; and emotional fluidity transports us into an underwater world where we are free to breathe again.
63,20170006,Art depends on a specific point of view. The Shape of Water is flawed; but there's no denying it's art.
64,20170006,[W]ith The Shape of Water; one of our greatest storytellers has made his masterpiece.
65,20170006,Something of a cinematic miracle -- the kind that Del Toro has given us over the years to the point where I'm starting to feel spoiled.
66,20170006,A love story birthed by a pure love of cinema that's derivative as it is celebratory of its many inspirations.
67,20170006,... Del Toro's willingness to court absurdity and bad taste serves to guarantee his integrity; proving he hasn't entirely gone respectable.
68,20170006,Pulses attractively like a luminous toyshop novelty; one inspired by The Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954).
69,20170006,Del Toro's greatest work. Simply magnificent.
70,20170006,The Shape of Water almost drowns in its own gorgeousness. It is a Beauty and the Beast fable where both get to be beautiful and neither has to be beastly.
71,20170006,All plot holes can be subsumed within the magical-realist tone for which Del Toro is famed. Yet there's an uncomfortable tension between the film's whimsical; Amélie-light (or; lighter) style and its clumsy political point-scoring.
72,20170006,Hawkins's performance throughout is career-defining. With her eyes; mouth and physicality; she finds a level of emotional eloquence to render speech redundant.
73,20170007,Ultimately; I feel confident in saying that you'll thoroughly enjoy Thor: Ragnarok. This is precision-engineered entertainment that wants you to have fun...
74,20170007,These films will only improve by giving a diverse group of filmmakers room to let their creative vision flourish; and their characters stumble.
75,20170007,Taika Waititi's irreverent humor makes this film delightful with a tongue in cheek tone.
76,20170007,I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
77,20170007,A fun Marvel movie.
78,20170007,Despite a few minor issues with pacing in the middle; this is a tremendous step in the right direction for both the Thor franchise specifically and Marvel movies in general.
79,20170007,The idea of pairing the oft-dull Thor with a series of oddball companions is an inspired; if necessary; move - so much so that it's baffling it has taken Marvel this long to smarten up.
80,20170007,Cate Blanchett's Hela is hella mean; hella snarky and hella striking with her hair slicked back into antlers.
81,20170007,This viewer ... was wowed in fits and starts; but mostly filled with a new; ungrudging respect for Hemsworth.
82,20170007,Perfectly acceptable as an action movie but inspired as a comedy--which is probably where the Thor franchise should have been aiming from the start.
83,20170007,Audiences seem to be smart enough these days to know a good movie when they see it; and to avoid a bad flick despite Hollywood's best efforts to pull a fast one on them.
84,20170007,Tessa's got the comedic timing to match Taika Waititi's Thor humor; and the physicality to lead the movie's pack of superheroes. She's not trying to outdo the boys; she's just trying to sip her drink and mind her own business.
85,20170008,When presented with a superior script; the cast stepped up.
86,20170008,Logan is a powerful; excellent film - a fitting farewell to what turned out to be one (or two) of the most enduring character portrayals in film history.
87,20170008,Logan is a solid ending for its title character and could easily be a high point for the X-Men series or a solid high to end on.
88,20170008,Logan works best if you have a history with the Wolverine character; but it's also remarkably impactful as a standalone film.
89,20170008,The thing that I liked the most about it was that it was a human story.
90,20170008,This is probably the best superhero movie I've seen in years.
91,20170008,Jackman gives Logan a withering rage that seems heartfelt; not hammy; Stewart is touching in his enraged befuddlement; and Keen; who resembles here what Katie Holmes might look like if she were Carrie; has a feral intensity.
92,20170008,Strips away the spandex; the posse and the chaos; distilling the story down to the essence of the man; Logan. What's left is the agony and the ecstasy of mutanthood.
93,20170008,Another expensive throwaway aimed at milking money out of people who still read comic books. Color it stupid.
94,20170008,Jackman and Stewart are why Logan works-why the film doesn't feel like a cheap exercise in bloody violence; and its subversion of typical superhero-movie tropes feels organic.
95,20170008,Make no mistake; Logan earns its tears. If Jackman and Stewart are serious about this being their mutual X-Men swan song; they could not have crafted a more heartfelt valedictory.
96,20170008,"The ending of ""Logan""... works in a bold and poignant way; providing the kind of closure that any story could be proud of."
97,20170009,This is a comedy with real-life stakes that's not about being cruel to anyone. It's also a little shaggy and loose; which is excusable because the characters are so fun to be around.
98,20170009,The Big Sick is so funny; so smart; so heartfelt that it demands to be seen.
99,20170009,...a universality that should prove broad enough for even the most close-minded of viewers...
100,20170009,The film is equal parts heartwarming and heartbreaking; and the entire package is completely entertaining thanks in large part to the eclectic and flawless cast.
101,20170009,I loved this movie. It was fabulous.
102,20170009,I really liked this movie.
103,20170009,Despite the aches and creaks in its extremities; The Big Sick is in rude health where it counts.
104,20170009,The Big Sick finds plots by losing them. That's its genius. One moment we are in an ethnic satire; the next a romcom; the next a hospital comedy-drama. But that's existence.
105,20170009,A hugely enjoyable; lovable comedy.
106,20170009,The film is a hoot. It's a hit. It's a smash.
107,20170009,Watching this Judd Apatow-produced romcom is like clicking on a for-real YouTube clip of a kitten juggling spoons. Cute. Clever. No wonder The Big Sick has gone viral.
108,20170009,After a slow start; the film gradually accumulates funny and surprising details; many of them surely drawn directly from life.
109,20170010,Overall; this is a profoundly satisfying episode without apparent weak spots (it's a notch disjointed; but nothing unbearable): You'll laugh; cry and be in awe...
110,20170010,Go see it on the biggest screen possible and let the little kid in you enjoy every moment of it.
111,20170010,This felt like paint by numbers.
112,20170010,This felt much more like a kid's movie to me.
113,20170010,Writer-director Rian Johnson has done a remarkable job making The Last Jedi a film that somehow both stands on its own and fits wonderfully into an ongoing journey.
114,20170010,The Last Jedi isn't perfect but is easily everything a Star Wars fan could want that expands the SW universe into bold new realms while deftly invoking the films we love and remember from a long; long time ago in a galaxy far; far away.
115,20170010,"In a world bursting with flashy popcorn movies; there's still nothing quite like a ""Star Wars"" flick."
116,20170010,The devoted will no doubt be delighted; for the rest; a resigned acceptance may be the safest path to enjoyment.
117,20170010,Fanatics will love it; for the rest of us; it's a tolerably good time.
118,20170010,While The Last Jedi may not receive top marks for originality; the eighth official entry in the Star Wars saga is still one of the most entertaining blockbusters of the year...
119,20170010,What's most interesting to me about The Last Jedi is Luke's return as the mentor rather than the student; grappling with his failure in this new role; and later aspiring to be the wise and patient teacher.
120,20170010,"""Star Wars"" is not ""Breaking Bad;"" and the same narrative tricks that worked for the latter feel jarringly out of place in the former."
121,20170011,Baby Driver is the kind of movie that justifies going to the movies...
122,20170011,This is pure filmmaking from a pure filmmaker with a pure vision; drawing from a well of creativity; film fandom; and a deep; abiding love for the craft.
123,20170011,The film is sweet and funny; if that's what you'd like in an action film.
124,20170011,Above all other things; Baby Driver is unfiltered entertainment; and sometimes that's exactly what the Doc ordered.
125,20170011,It definitely feels like a 17 to 18 year-old boy's -- who just discovered Tarantino and Bullitt -- wet dream.
126,20170011,It was like Birdman: Tokyo Drift.
127,20170011,The influences are there; but Wright builds on and subverts them in his hugely entertaining movie; one of the most satisfying films of its type to emerge in quite a while.
128,20170011,It's all bolted together like clockwork; an assemblage of elements designed to arouse and engage an audience that needs a reason to stop looking at their phones.
129,20170011,America gives Wright his boss tunes; his cinematic influences and a ticket to ride. There's also the risk of hubris attached to that freedom; as becomes apparent here.
130,20170011,Baby Driver is a super fun action film that uses music as its hook as opposed to over-the-top stunts and special effects.
131,20170011,Terrific; character-driven action comedy... Wright again shows his mastery of blending comedy with high-octane action.
132,20170011,But whether you're in it for the music or just for the ride; Baby Driver is an entertaining car movie with an engine and a beat.
133,20170012,Emotional; action-packed and beautifully shot; War for the Planet of the Apes delivers something that some film franchises have failed - a brilliant threequel.
134,20170012,The motion-captured apes look amazingly real and convincing.
135,20170012,podcast review
136,20170012,Have you ever dreamed of a world where you could see The Bridge Over the River Kwai; Star Wars; Apocalypse Now; The Great Escape; and The Ten Commandments remade with gorillas; monkeys; and orangutans?... We finally live in that world.
137,20170012,War for the Planet of the Apes is a great film; and it's the end of one of the best science fiction trilogies made in years.
138,20170012,There's a depth here that most big-budget films simply don't even aspire to; let alone achieve. And if the visual effects team doesn't take home the Oscar; nothing should.
139,20170012,The best summer blockbuster in years; a smart; thoughtful; confrontational and challenging allegory for a world run amok.
140,20170012,Serkis has invented an entirely new medium of performance - one that pushes the series into a realm that would have blown poor George Taylor's mind even more than a half-buried Lady Liberty.
141,20170012,War for the Planet of the Apes; the third in the rebooted trilogy; is among the best of the series.
142,20170012,"With its allusions to Shakespeare; Joseph Conrad; the Bible; American slavery and the civil-rights movement; ""War"" may not be subtle but it's ultimate proof that summer sequels and blockbusters don't have to be brain-dead bottom-feeders either."
143,20170012,Although it rouses and overwhelms; it ain't much fun. ... Still; there is much to relish.
144,20170012,Reeves tells a big story that's satisfying in many ways.
145,20170013,The scenes feel and most likely are improvised; giving them a sizzling energy that (often literally) screams authenticity and speaks volumes about the protagonists' furiously nomadic way of life.
146,20170013,What sets this film apart is that director Baker does a great job of presenting these characters in an unjaundiced; authentic way.
147,20170013,The Florida Project is just like Moonee and her mother - loud; confident and brutally honest. An explosion of vivid colours; creative camerawork and amazing performances; it is one of the most engaging films this year.
148,20170013,Sean Baker's latest is an achievement in empathy.
149,20170013,Keenly observational and heart-wrenchingly real. The young actors steal the show in this guy-wrenching drama.
150,20170013,Baker makes films like no one else; and they are as vital to understanding America as anything you'll see in this or most other years. It will win you with compassion and warmth; while simultaneously shaking you to your core.
151,20170013,The Florida Project is a song of innocence and of experience: mainly the former.
152,20170013,The Florida Project is one of the best films about childhood made anywhere in recent years.
153,20170013,The Florida Project absolutely sings as a visual achievement; and not only as that.
154,20170013,The camera; if especially respectful towards the children; refuses to demonise any of the characters.
155,20170013,Little Moonee is innocent in every sense that counts; and even her worst misdeeds are fuelled by excitement at the possibilities of life.
156,20170013,I knew form the first shot that I was watching a truly great movie... It's so real; it's so raw.
157,20170014,Spider-Man: Homecoming is funny; action-packed and really smart; with [Tom] Holland being the best Spidey to date.
158,20170014,Spider-Man: Homecoming is a brilliantly fun film which re-imagines the popular Marvel character with little; if any; room for criticism.
159,20170014,How much weight can the resolution really hold for Parker; when all it does is fall back on Marvel's original sin of affirming the status quo? It can't help but feel like a really good Tony Stark story nestled between incomplete Spidey adventures.
160,20170014,The human-sized stakes make it more exciting; and it's considerably easier to follow the action with fewer moving parts. You don't come out of the film feeling like you've been beaten over the head for the last half hour.
161,20170014,Tom Holland is good. Really damn good.
162,20170014,Spider-Man: Homecoming is as perfect a portrait of Peter Parker as I've ever seen; and one of the best Marvel movies to date. Face it; tiger. We just hit the jackpot.
163,20170014,Headlined by a winning performance from Tom Holland as a teenager enduring a truly demanding puberty; Spider-Man: Homecoming downscales the superhero movie.
164,20170014,This is the Spidey movie we've been waiting for. It's also the best Spider-Man movie of the bunch.
165,20170014,Director Jon Watts has learned from his predecessors that the huge set-piece scenes only work with Spider-Man if there's a character point being made.
166,20170014,This is a charming; funny; coming-of-age story about a 15-year-old; Peter Parker; who has more power than he can handle and at the same time is frustrated that he can't show it off.
167,20170014,A strangely oblivious film; one that undercuts its story with exactly the sort of praise-hungriness that its hero learns to overcome.
168,20170014,"If ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" is to be judged solely on its ability to unite a diverse audience behind a fun motion picture; it seems to have succeeded wildly."
169,20170015,Director Raoul Peck weaves a breathtaking cinematic tapestry. Drawing from old interviews and college lectures; popular movies; blues music; and Baldwin's poetic words; Peck takes us on a tour of history.
170,20170015,Thirty years after his death; Baldwin's words and deeds still speak to an America that needs to listen.
171,20170015,I Am Not Your Negro is montage and meditation; a dialogue between the archive and the present; a road movie without the road.
172,20170015,[It] isn't just a biography of an intellectual or a history lesson about resistance towards white supremacy. The film is all of that; and more; a clear-eyed examination of the ugly wound in the land of the free.
173,20170015,Baldwin's fury and his despair come through in vivid fashion; making this film not just an important social document; but an essential work of art.
174,20170015,Simply put; I Am Not Your Negro is essential viewing for all Americans.
175,20170015,Baldwin was writing more than 30 years ago. Not so much has changed since then. Even so; I Am Not Your Negro isn't as pessimistic as its downbeat tone suggests it should be. Baldwin's commentary is intended to provoke; not to induce despair.
176,20170015,[A] forcefully eloquent movie.
177,20170015,Raoul Peck's lyrical documentary was nominated for an Oscar this year; and it really should have won.
178,20170015,Baldwin re-emerges as a devastatingly eloquent speaker and public intellectual; a figure who deserves his place alongside Edward Said; Frantz Fanon or Gore Vidal.
179,20170015,... Baldwin's words - sometimes spoken by Samuel L. Jackson - guide us through the narrative; which marries archival footage of Baldwin in interviews and forums with film of his era's political and cultural milestones.
180,20170015,I Am Not Your Negro is an utterly brilliant film - bold; galvanising; even gripping...
181,20170016,McDonagh has once again crafted a brilliantly violent and emotionally charged script about anger; revenge; regret; unfulfillment and justice that isn't always served.
182,20170016,Three Billboards Outside Ebbing; Missouri tells us that anger can have its uses; and it does so in a way that's funny; profound; and heartbreaking. This is one of the best films of the year.
183,20170016,Perhaps it takes an outsider like McDonagh to get it right; but by picture's end; a few wrenches of plot unite the deplorable with Mildred and lend him a contrived sympathy.
184,20170016,It's an interesting movie; just don't take it too seriously.
185,20170016,Amazing performances.
186,20170016,Embrace Three Billboards; hold it tight; even if you feel like it's trying to punch you in the face. And in the process; you might be able to share a fraction of the resonance at work in it.
187,20170016,Three Billboards Outside Ebbing; Missouri tells the story of a woman emulating God's vengeance when she might profit more by emulating his forgiveness; especially toward herself.
188,20170016,"But while that is a rage that's exhilarating to witness; it's a rage that's not available to everyone. Just as not everyone in Ebbing can claim the protection of being considering ""good;"" we still don't live in a world where everyone gets to be angry."
189,20170016,Give all the awards to McDormand; and then invent a bunch of new ones for her too.
190,20170016,Watching it is like having your funny bone struck repeatedly; expertly and very much too hard by a karate super-black-belt capable of bringing a rhino to its knees with a single punch behind the ear.
191,20170016,Three Billboards is great.
192,20170016,Sound too bleak? For some; perhaps. But in McDonagh's careful hands; it's a Cirque du Soleil-like tightrope walk; gracefully balancing the harrowing with the humorous.
193,20170017,Almost every one of the fudges makes the film more entertaining and less truthful.
194,20170017,It's a terrific story told with a lot of verve and charm.
195,20170017,Taraji P. Henson; Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monáe are very; very hard to dislike.
196,20170017,"Watching Taraji P. Henson; Octavia Spencer and Kansas City; Kansas homie Janelle Monáe bringing all to life is a ""Hallelujah moment."""
197,20170017,Do yourself a favor and see Hidden Figures. It's that good.
198,20170017,Hidden Figures is almost all preaching with very little movie to speak of; and what movie is there is so broad that much of the message falls flat.
199,20170017,A superb cast and a true-life story long overdue in the telling.
200,20170017,Very nice and entertaining.
201,20170017,All the three leads were fantastic.
202,20170017,Yes; the story may have been panel-beaten into a gleaming; Oscar-friendly shape. That Hidden Figures is still so entertaining and moving is due in large part to a hugely likeable central trio of performances.
203,20170017,Directed with Oscar-baiting flourish by Theodore Melfi; Hidden Figures works well as a well-meaning; corrective history lesson designed to honour the talented women who worked away in historical silence while castigating the system that oppressed them.
204,20170017,As [Melfi] proved in his previous film; St Vincent; he's good with actors and is a competent storyteller; but he can't resist underlining things that are already obvious.
205,20170018,Echoing a bygone era of studio films daring to push boundaries and expectations rather than demurely adhering to them; Blade Runner 2049 is every bit a soliloquy of dread in response to Scott's ballet of violence.
206,20170018,Blade Runner 2049 is one of the best sci-fi films I've seen in a long time; and certainly the equal to the first film.
207,20170018,The film's running time is hefty; but its pleasures are deep and satisfying. Villeneuve's direction is brilliant; and if Deakins doesn't win an Oscar for this cinematography; the award has no meaning. See it on the largest screen you can find.
208,20170018,This is an art piece.
209,20170018,Everything fit together... I was a fan.
210,20170018,Fills the screen with breathtaking visuals that are worthy of repeat viewings; presents ideas that will have you contemplating big-picture concepts for days after you see it; and provides a stage for stellar performances from Gosling on down.
211,20170018,Villeneuve and cinematographer Roger Deakins give us staggering new visions of the future; ones that confound and trance and mystify in Blade Runner 2049 even while making rich cinematic senses.
212,20170018,The rare sequel that truly merits its existence; updating and expanding the themes of the 1982 original to bring them from the 20th century into the 21st.
213,20170018,Blade Runner 2049; on the other hand; manages to be prettier but far more prosaic.
214,20170018,A meditative and moving film; sumptuously photographed by legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins in the finest and most astonishing work of his career.
215,20170018,From the grayed-out countrysides over which the sky has closed like a lid; to the drizzly neon decadence of Los Angeles; to the Ozymandian wreckage of Las Vegas-the film is a visual splendor of the first order.
216,20170018,Watching Ford and Gosling onscreen together suggests an evolution of masculinity within the films; one that exists along a continuum of noir leading men; from those failing to hide their tenderhearted nature to the solemn figures who make stoicism an art.
217,20170019,By directing and acting in a movie about a bad actor/director; Franco the movie star made himself vulnerable -- and created the best film of his career.
218,20170019,Franco is all business portraying it's writer; director; producer and possible vampire and his strange behavior during the making of the movie. Oscar nomination for Franco? Better be. Oscar nomination for the movie? Possibly.
219,20170019,The Disaster Artist is undeniably fun; but just skin deep.
220,20170019,What it all amounts to is a tremendously funny feel good film that doesn't quite stand on its own so much as it plays as a great (the BEST; really) companion-piece to The Room that a cult film fan could ask for.
221,20170019,If you've never seen The Room; don't try to figure out the phenomenon; simply enjoy witnessing the [creation] of it. And if you are; in fact; a Room devotee; prepare to laugh harder than you have ever laughed in your life.
222,20170019,t's an underdog story that ultimately has the last laugh; given we're watching James Franco recreate Tommy's life for a film that has become the dark horse this awards season.
223,20170019,"Franco delivers a comedy that's delightfully offbeat. It probably helps if you've actually seen ""The Room;"" but you can safely spare yourself that experience."
224,20170019,I can't fault Franco and his collaborators for feeling affection for Wiseau; who after all has given so much joy to so many people; if only by accident.
225,20170019,Wiseau; The Room and the making of a celluloid catastrophe are the subjects of The Disaster Artist; a fabulous; strange and frequently hilarious comedy-drama from the self-styled polymath James Franco.
226,20170019,"""The Disaster Artist"" is a sweet; emotionally engaging tribute to friendship; the movies and the importance of dreams."
227,20170019,Wiseau also makes a pretty good avatar for Franco himself: a mercurial; relentless performer whose ambition encompasses a thrilling willingness to crash and burn. And it's that identification that makes the comedy work here: Franco kids because he loves.
228,20170019,Funny -- sometimes brutally -- and surprisingly touching; it works whether you've seen the source material or not; though there are plentiful shout-outs to die-hard fans.
229,20170020,It's well-made; well-shot and well-cast; just slightly turgid in its approach; which results in turning the viewer off rather than engaging with their emotions and sense of justice throughout.
230,20170020,Like the mud; it makes you feel dirty and you cannot wash it off. It's not a comfortable feeling; and it's not meant to be. Instead; Mudbound challenges you to identify with these broken people. And we do.
231,20170020,Takes a familiar story and makes it feel fresh; and is the perfect example of why we need more films directed by women and people of color.
232,20170020,To watch Mudbound is to remember that unfathomably disgusting crimes perpetrated against the black community aren't just stored in paper; film and photographs; they're stored in the actual memories of those still living.
233,20170020,The cast is one of the reasons to defend 'Mudbound'; since it delivers powerful moments. [Full Review in Spanish]
234,20170020,There is a lot of sin to go around in Mudbound; a film whose agrarian setting feels like a sort of Paradise Lost.
235,20170020,Mudbound is as relevant today as it was after World War II.
236,20170020,Yet; it is the sweet chemistry between Hedlund and Mitchell that saves the film; as their characters share a camaraderie that feels unique and familiar at the same time.
237,20170020,Under stellar direction by Dee Rees; we can't help but empathize with the hardships of the characters.
238,20170020,Mudbound is a raw; historical family drama with a Faulkernian cadence.
239,20170020,It's as thoroughly entertaining as it is thematically prescient.
240,20170020,This is an astonishing work that deserves a big-screen run alongside the best films of 2017. If you have the opportunity to catch it in theaters; do so with all haste.
241,20170021,There is one word for this film: Wonderful!
242,20170021,A collaboration between Agnès Varda and French artist JR that sees the duo traveling the countryside; bringing art to small villages while playfully examining their creative approaches.
243,20170021,Even in its brief melancholy moments-and there are a few of those; as Varda confronts the inevitable passing of time-it remains an entirely poignant exploration of life and love and whatever it is inside each of us that connects all of us.
244,20170021,The soul-stirring original music by Matthieu Chedid complement the meaningful duo collaboration.
245,20170021,...a palatable; easily digestible film that is as ephemeral as the murals showcased in it.
246,20170021,It's just 90 minutes of distilled joy.
247,20170021,"There's a chemistry and respect between the two of them; palpable in the film's first moments; that is inspiring. And when the credits roll 89 minutes later; you realize that this is one journey where you never once crankily asked; ""Are we there yet?"""
248,20170021,"""Faces Places"" is a lively; fun; stirring tribute to art and its ability to touch people and bring souls together."
249,20170021,A typical; even archetypal; Varda mixture of the combative and the contemplative.
250,20170021,A beguiling and utterly unique piece of work.
251,20170021,It's more than wandering whimsy; with telling comments on decaying industry and Instagram narcissism and a sting in the tail that can only be described as Godardian.
252,20170021,Faces Places is the most melancholy yet uplifting buddy movie you'll see all year.
253,20170022,A beautiful; poignant; exquisite gift of a film.
254,20170022,Beautifully animated and incredibly sweet; it is an entertaining feature debut from [Claude] Barras.
255,20170022,As devastating as the film can be; it is also sublimely joyous.
256,20170022,With red frosted noses; sleepy bobble eyes; and oversize; oblong heads; the stop-motion munchkins of My Life as a Zucchini are figures approached with curious affection.
257,20170022,Zucchini dares to take on some fairly heavy subjects... but it does so with delicacy and compassion; showing the survival skills and resiliency of these expressive and intricately crafted characters. It's an exceptionally heartfelt offering.
258,20170022,....an utterly charming French claymation...
259,20170022,It's a little masterpiece.
260,20170022,Somewhere in the mysterious space between the script and the animation; My Life as a Courgette boasts moments of (yes; whisper it) essential human truth that will leave you floored.
261,20170022,It is a lovely little film; coming in at a novella-size 66 minutes.
262,20170022,My Life as a Courgette isn't perfect (some of the adult characters lack nuance) but its attempt to redefine innocence is stirring.
263,20170022,This isn't just good writing; it's humane and honourable. Every child here feels like a real human being; and as such is accorded a dignity the world invariably hasn't extended to them in their lives to date.
264,20170022,Running barely longer than an hour; My Life as a Zucchini doesn't go into any great depth in terms of either story or emotion. That's disappointing.
265,20170023,Don't miss this film; and if you're not already familiar with the play within the film; this is a great excuse to correct that.
266,20170023,Slow moving and emotionally involving; Farhadi's The Salesman is immaculately crafted but lacks the power and potency of A Seperation.
267,20170023,There is a reason Farhadi is an award-winning filmmaker and The Salesman is a shining example of his excellent work.
268,20170023,Farhadi's strength lies in his ability to cast adept performers able to convey the subtle complexities of his prose; and what Taraneh Alidoosti and Shahab Hosseini achieve here is exciting as it is troubling.
269,20170023,The Salesman may challenge some preconceptions; without losing sight of the problems that still affect the country.
270,20170023,As an unfiltered drama; the film works to perfection; as a crime story; the pacing and flow are so unlike what Western audiences are used to; it might seems strange and oddly constructed.
271,20170023,Feelgood is a word unlikely ever to find its way into Farhadi's vocabulary. But he does know a lot about truth and consequences and how to apply them to the anatomy of a marriage.
272,20170023,The ending is brave and interesting. Before that; the subtleties of relationship breakdown are finely charted. But elsewhere there is too much gauche alternation between symbolic parallelisms ...
273,20170023,The Salesman shows Farhadi's ideas are in danger of becoming mannerisms; though it is a potent; disquieting piece of work.
274,20170023,It's wellacted and full of low-key pain and humour (you would expect nothing less from the man behind A Separation; one of the most excruciatingly humane and nuanced films of the decade).
275,20170023,[A] quietly provocative drama.
276,20170023,In its oddly quiet and deliberate way; it's a thrilling film to watch.
277,20170024,Along with the amusing characters and straightforward plot; Logan Lucky is pure entertainment.
278,20170024,podcast review
279,20170024,It probably goes without saying that the photography and editing are beyond reproach; but I'm going to say it anyway. Logan Lucky is a ruthlessly designed and executed entertainment machine; but its obvious virtues may obscure its depth.
280,20170024,The story itself doesn't matter; and in fact; has never really mattered. It's all about how the story is told. Here; we have a cheerful and frequently funny caper that feels like a tall tale told among friends having a few drinks.
281,20170024,Logan Lucky blends humor as well as excitement; sans the edginess you may expect in a Soderbergh picture.
282,20170024,Easily one of the funniest things you'll see this year; but it moves so far beyond simply trying to make us laugh that you may have to watch it a few times to understand how beautifully subversive Soderbergh is in fleshing out his characters.
283,20170024,The film's comedy is loose and generous; and its esprit de corps sneaks up on you with a soft tread.
284,20170024,We admire the cheek and chic of how it's done. We wonder quite why it was thought worth doing.
285,20170024,It's always supremely watchable; but rarely; if ever; commits itself to genuine jeopardy or suspense.
286,20170024,Soderbergh directs with his trademark pace and panache; but to this he adds an obvious affection for his hapless hillbilly heroes.
287,20170024,Wildly entertaining.
288,20170024,Soderbergh films the movie with swing; relishing the overlapping and intertwining strands of the complex plot; the brightly lit personalities of the characters it involves; and the magnificently conceived; essential tiny details ...
289,20170025,Fun for kids; but mostly forgettable for everyone else; it's possible to have a good time with The LEGO Batman Movie; but don't expect it to replace Tim Burton or Christopher Nolan's efforts as your favourite movie starring The Dark Knight.
290,20170025,The kind of irreverent superhero movie master-built to keep both the kids and their parental guardians as happy as each other.
291,20170025,The personal growth storyline is glib; clichéd; and irritating. But the real question is; what is that personal growth storyline doing there at all? Who looked at Lego Batman and thought; what is the state of this Cowled Lego's soul?
292,20170025,It would all be lightweight and completely disposable it if weren't for the bits of stunning animation that pop up every five minutes or so. The visual inventiveness of LEGO Batman far surpasses anything the DC franchise has produced.
293,20170025,The Lego Batman Movie is fun (and funny); but not quite as awesome as its predecessor.
294,20170025,The Lego Batman Movie isn't just a superhero story; it's a crash course in what makes a superhero story. And most of it is fairly insightful; humorous; and/or well observed -- clearly from the mind of die-hard comic book aficionados.
295,20170025,Overall; The Lego Batman Movie offers enough action and silliness to enthrall children while providing sufficient pop culture and Batman-through-the-years references to keep adults entertained.
296,20170025,The thing about a sequel or a spinoff; even a mostly fun one like The LEGO Batman Movie; is that it's hard to recreate enthusiasm and inventiveness. What was once new is now; already; routine.
297,20170025,The sequel of sorts... is not quite as good; but at its best; it has the same whiplash wit and inspired freneticism.
298,20170025,The Lego Batman Movie works precisely because it knows audiences are sick of its hero. It's a reassessment; an intervention; an effort to try and remember what's fun about him.
299,20170025,What's missing is any trace of 1980s-style punk cynicism to underpin the pop playfulness; instead; there's a complacency which is death to humour.
300,20170025,Emotion can reside in the unlikeliest packages. But there's not a lot of it on show here. The animation; however; is terrific and fans of the original should love it.
301,20170026,It is a film that will stay with you possibly forever also thanks to a killer soundtrack of selected; remixed cult hit songs and a score composed by Arnaud Rebotini.
302,20170026,BPM (Beats Per Minute) is; for once; a stellar consideration for some of the courageous souls who dedicated their lives to the activism which eventually resulted in necessary visibility.
303,20170026,"Far from simply an ""issue"" film; BPM is an incisive; moving portrait of what it feels like to occupy its subjects' skin; to feel a sense of both acute sexual ecstasy and love and also a powerful; encroaching doom."
304,20170026,BPM is a stone cold masterpiece.
305,20170026,BPM does make for a compelling snapshot of a time and place where activism felt more critical and necessary; when the rules of engagement were not just about winning but about survival.
306,20170026,The powerful new French drama BPM (Beats Per Minute) immediately makes the personal political.
307,20170026,[BPM] devotes significant screen time to philosophical debate but also appeals to the senses with graphic sex and a throbbing techno score by Arnaud Rebotini.
308,20170026,[Director] Campillo tries to give both personal and political equal weight (or at least equal screen time); and proves more adept at the latter: never have highly regulated meetings to propose policy and review results been so richly engaging.
309,20170026,"""BPM"" is an affecting memorial about being alive and being heard - a movie that says the only things that matter in life are love; righteous struggle; and the joy of being with others. It shakes all three until their atoms get up and dance."
310,20170026,The film captures very vividly indeed the urgency and turbulence of the period in which the AIDS epidemic took hold.
311,20170026,Perhaps more impressively [director Robin Campillo] squeezes drama from the group meetings; which in most films would be snooze-fests.
312,20170026,And yet BPM (meaning beats per minute) is a beautiful film; full of drama and humour; love and politics; argument and action.
313,20170027,Lee also avoids gross sentiment; aiming instead for a message extolling the possibility of hope for a fulfilling; gay relationship set in the kinds of rural climes where ignorance; repression; and eventual tragedy usually reign supreme.
314,20170027,This is a love story; a truly great one; showing the transformative and healing powers of loving and being loved. It's moving; beautiful and will be one of the best films of 2017.
315,20170027,If you like your romantic dramas with a side of social critique; look no further.
316,20170027,God's Own Country is a film where every frame is full of light and texture specifically designed to convey the subtle nuances of this relationship; and to give it a specificity anchored in this place and time.
317,20170027,[A] compelling; if subdued drama.
318,20170027,This movie is a beautifully poignant slow burn with a stellar cast. I highly recommend you watch God's Own Country.
319,20170027,Combining gritty realism with poignancy; the result is a film that is exceptionally moving.
320,20170027,This is not a movie about coming out and the collateral damage that ensues. It's a universal tale about giving yourself over to love; even when you seem hopelessly broken.
321,20170027,The film by writer-director Francis Lee; who grew up on a Yorkshire farm before turning to acting - and; later; filmmaking - is sweet; even if Johnny is not.
322,20170027,But O'Connor and Secareanu give such aching performances that their romance feels real.
323,20170027,"Director/writer Francis Lee's electrifying feature debut is a working-class; fun-house mirror version of ""Call Me By Your Name's"" upper-class pretensions and is equally; if not more; rewarding because of it."
324,20170027,Writer-director Francis Lee creates a more credible rural milieu; anchored in the grubby details of raising livestock and the furious emotional repression of his male characters.
325,20170028,An unusual and life-affirming documentary...
326,20170028,If they are already a real beauty; they look even more appealing thanks to the considerable technical qualities of the film. [Full Review in Spanish]
327,20170028,It is such a well-done labor of love that you wish the film had one thing: a narrative.
328,20170028,When you imagine mesmerizing online cat videos made classy and educational; then mashed up with a gorgeous geographic documentary on a historic city; you'll be ready to sit down and absorb this delightful film.
329,20170028,It doesn't seem unjustly catty to expect that a film so much about a city recently rocked by protests; mass demonstrations; systemic crackdowns on basic human rights... should reflect rather than ignore those realities.
330,20170028,Time spent with each cat is like a micro-story of survival; resourcefulness; humor; and tolerance on both sides of the equation. The more time we spend with them; the more fascinating and curious they become.
331,20170028,This is the film the world needs right now.
332,20170028,It is by turns intriguing; amusing and a little bit twee.
333,20170028,You needn't be a cat lover to enjoy Kedi; since the film will make you one anyway.
334,20170028,Filmed at whisker-height; this charming documentary enters the daily lives of the many street cats of Istanbul.
335,20170028,Everything is of the moment: the filmmakers spend a few moments or minutes with one person and cat; then move on.
336,20170028,Kedi ('cat' in Turkish) is much more than a cute film showing these felines' day-to-day lives.
337,20170029,Continuously unearths affecting ways of making cantankerous endearing.
338,20170029,Lucky is all about the metatextual pleasure of spending 90 final minutes with one of cinema's all-time most entertaining actors; and for that; it is a pure gift.
339,20170029,Harry Dean Stanton gave the movie world a gift with his last and final performance. It is a fitting tribute to a man who's body of work contained only two lead roles; in this film and in Paris; Texas.
340,20170029,If you truly value cinema and the importance of an actor's craft; you'll make the effort to appreciate this affecting swan song.
341,20170029,Lucky could best be described as a hangout movie; and I mean that as the highest of compliments.
342,20170029,You shouldn't go see Lucky... just because Stanton died not long ago. You should go because it's a wonderful; fundamentally life-affirming film that honors much of what made Stanton so unique both as a person and an actor.
343,20170029,It's both subtle and deceptively simple - a great tribute to a performer who never underestimated the power of understatement.
344,20170029,John Carroll Lynch; who's worked with everyone from Martin Scorsese to Albert Brooks; doesn't explicitly borrow from any of his directors; though it's clear from his careful precision that he learned a little something from all of them.
345,20170029,A sad; sweet movie.
346,20170029,Those gentle jowls; that hawkish nose; those quirky; popping eyes and the incomparable slur of that slow-jazz vocal delivery are what keep us in our seats; even when we fidget a bit.
347,20170029,This is a subtle; unhurried film - not sentimental in the usual sense; but studded with moments of poignant; low-key strangeness.
348,20170029,Stanton's navy veteran quietly dominates virtually every frame; weather-beaten as the landscape around his small American town.
349,20170030,More of the same; but that's not necessarily a bad thing.
350,20170030,There's a complete mix of fun; laughs and A LOT of emotions all thrown into one epic saga.
351,20170030,There are still familiar elements; like the early-80's pop tunes that add to the exuberance of the film; overall the film has a vibrant joy that's infectious. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is the antidote for grimdark foolishness...
352,20170030,In the end; it isn't about whether it's a better movie than the first installment; like most of the characters within; it's more mature and substantial and doesn't rely on past accomplishments to make it great.
353,20170030,I had a lot of fun in this movie.
354,20170030,A really fun time.
355,20170030,Director James Gunn has a vision and he puts it across; but it ain't pretty.
356,20170030,The reunion of the Guardians cements Pratt's mega-stardom. He has a shaggy young Kurt Russell vibe (think Big Trouble in Little China;). And Russell himself is a great addition to the ensemble; providing a dose of kick-back; kick-ass action
357,20170030,[Yondu's] presence kicks the idling movie into gear; and into a final third act for which all of the previous meandering can be forgiven - and the talk of family finally accrues the weight the film has been trying to put on it.
358,20170030,Let's hope that Vol. 3 recaptures the fizz of the original; instead of slumping into the most expensive group-therapy session in the universe.
359,20170030,"As Baby Groot's companions battle the tentacular horror in the background; we're treated to the delightful spectacle of the mini-veggie juking his way through ""Mr. Blue Sky"" in the opening credits."
360,20170030,In Marvel lingo; Guardians 2 feels like a great six-issue arc; the kind of storytelling that used to be the backbone of superhero comics.
361,20170031,A striking yet disconsolate piece of visual poetry on the passage of time; the potential meaningless of existence; and an inescapable cycle of destruction and rebirth.
362,20170031,Stuck under the sheet; Affleck becomes a figure model; little more than a prop for the rest of the film to revolve around. But it's brilliant and poignant.
363,20170031,Here is a film that's alive-truly alive-in a way very few are.
364,20170031,Rooney Mara is absolutely amazing in her performance of grief and learning to live without a loved one. She embodies sadness and determination in how she just keeps going after the hardest event of her life.
365,20170031,A Ghost Story is a film I'm desperate to see again; if only to understand how and why it brought me such a great sense of comfort; as if Lowery knows something that the rest of us only suspect.
366,20170031,Delivers upscale chills for the art-house crowd.
367,20170031,It's such an original conceit; perfectly matched by the execution: the alternately plaintive and strange soundtrack; cinematography that places the stock spectral image into one gorgeously surreal frame after another; the performances.
368,20170031,Completely unlike anything else you'll see this year.
369,20170031,A meditation on loss but also on legacy - on our enduring need to endure.
370,20170031,I'm going to simply say that I loved this movie; even if I don't quite know what it was about.
371,20170031,The film stubbornly refuses to connect with its deeper themes because of a vague; self-consciously arty structure and a pace so deliberate it approaches a stand-still.
372,20170031,The unconventional narrative structure seems more beguiling the more you think about it - this is a film designed to expand in your memory.
373,20170032,There are plenty of cinematic touchstones for which Your Name is comparable; but the end result still feels like the rarest find of all: a truly original work of mainstream cinema.
374,20170032,Two lovers transcending time and space to connect is an inspiring story no matter what country you hail from.
375,20170032,It's bold and stunning with great characters and original storytelling.
376,20170032,While Your Name's story is dubious; it doesn't disappoint. One of the standout features from London Film Festival; and one of the best animated features this year.
377,20170032,Your Name is a genuine delight of a movie; an emotional adventure that crosses multiple genres. Shinaki seamlessly blends romance with science fiction to incredible effect.
378,20170032,To say this film involves bending time doesn't even really begin to describe it; but it all makes sense in this universe; and it's a bold and beautiful wonder to behold.
379,20170032,This concept could be used for stock shenanigans worthy of a John Green novel; but Shinkai unleashes a twist early on so clever and cerebral that J.J. Abrams and Christopher Nolan will kick themselves for not thinking of it first.
380,20170032,With its balance of grounded emotion and wondrous escapism; Your Name should firmly establish Shinkai as an auteur to follow for many years to come.
381,20170032,"You may have to fortify your illogicality tolerance when viewing the anime adventure ""Your Name."" But this body-swap romance by the exciting and talented filmmaker Makoto Shinkai is nonetheless exquisite; beautiful and entertaining."
382,20170032,Throughout; there is the nagging sense that the whole thing will unravel if any one thread gets tugged too hard; but when both the heart and the sky are on fire; why lean in and go squinting at flaws?
383,20170032,It's both gorgeous enough and emotionally engaging enough to be worth seeking out.
384,20170032,Plot hiccups aside; it's a visually impressive experience with endearing characters and a unique story.
385,20170033,...the believed-lost footage of a 26-year-old Goodall from the early 1960s is illuminating from beginning to end and a technicolour dream.
386,20170033,The beautiful vintage footage and Phillip Glass' striving; uplifting score make the film a pleasant journey as well as a delightful; insightful one.
387,20170033,Thrilling. Heartbreaking. Incandescently beautiful.
388,20170033,Here's a family-friendly winner of a film...
389,20170033,Edited together with a fluidity and polish rare even in the best documentary films.
390,20170033,Jane is easily one of the finest documentaries of the year and should be a major contender come awards season.
391,20170033,... a fascinating affair; both as a natural history film and as a closely focused study of a woman who lived her own real-life version of The Jungle Book.
392,20170033,A portrait of the primatologist as a young woman.
393,20170033,It's most evocative as a memorable portrait of a woman; both in youth and late life; who always knew what she wanted - and who; in doing so; helped make the world a better place.
394,20170033,Brett Morgen's elegant if rather one-note documentary follows Jane Goodall; one of the top authorities on chimpanzees; from fearless twentysomething to respected eco-ambassador.
395,20170033,Like so many women in pursuit of their studies; Goodall had to tolerate being studied herself.
396,20170033,Watching Jane was like stepping back in time to a moment at which Homo sapiens learned something new and vital about its own family - the great apes. It was extraordinary.
397,20170034,Pattinson once again proves his abilities to disappear into a fully fleshed out characterization; here as a selfish yet sympathetic deadbeat.
398,20170034,A fun; fiery; fatigue-defying ride.
399,20170034,podcast review
400,20170034,Like the revisionist westerns of the 1970s; it takes the conflicted heroes of gangster films and shows them in a different; less flattering light.
401,20170034,A nerve-wracking crime adventure loaded with thrills; sleazy characters; and a distinctly New York flavour.
402,20170034,Anchored by a career-best performance by Pattinson; it's an unforgettable work that will rattle you in all the best ways.
403,20170034,"This isn't conventional Hollywood-horror/thriller ""suspense"" but something more primal."
404,20170034,If you come away from it with nothing else; Pattinson's performance is solid enough to make you forgive him those vampire movies: everyone has to start somewhere.
405,20170034,An intoxicating downer odyssey.
406,20170034,Few of the characters have the first idea what might be coming next - nor do we; strapped into this feral shaggy dog story the Safdies have set rolling; hurtling towards their brilliant future.
407,20170034,The Safdie brothers' crime thriller Good Time is a chaotic; wildly inventive but increasingly self-indulgent affair.
408,20170034,The urgent docu-style filming is impressive; but it's Pattinson's fearless turn that lingers.
409,20170035,Heineman's gift as a filmmaker remains in the profoundly visceral quality of his material.
410,20170035,The story; as assembled; therefore reflects the refugees' shifting situations; with a naturalistic combination of horror; tenderness and the vicarious heroic kick of seeing journalists sticking it to wrongdoers.
411,20170035,The film is worth seeing for its personal stories and its realism; because real life rarely has the neat endings of fiction.
412,20170035,Documentaries don't get any timelier and pressing than director Matthew Heineman's follow-up to Cartel Land.
413,20170035,City of Ghosts works urgently...the grainy and grisly images contrast deeply with the Islamic State's own slick filmic efforts that ironically and blatantly mimic the language of Hollywood movies with unsettling efficiency.
414,20170035,As powerful a profile on courage and the war on terror as you'll ever see.
415,20170035,A clearly significant document; bringing compassionate immediacy and personalised humanity to an unfolding catastrophe.
416,20170035,"Heineman powerfully captures the agonizing sense of displacement these men must feel. Gaunt; lanky; chain-smoking RBSS founder Aziz is an emotionally wounded; haunted figure. The ""ghosts"" in the title doesn't just apply to those killed in Raqqa."
417,20170035,"""City of Ghosts"" isn't merely about the personal sacrifices of these men; but a testament to the necessity of a free and open press the world over."
418,20170035,An important story that loses something in the telling.
419,20170035,This film will give you a new appreciation for the freedoms that are often taken for granted in a democracy.
420,20170035,Astonishing viewing - but it will haunt you.
421,20170036,How do you see the world?
422,20170036,Unique characters; beautiful cinematography; and elegiac tone.
423,20170036,Columbus is one of those gems that doesn't seem like anything extraordinary until you're sitting through the credits trying to absorb what you just watched.
424,20170036,A rarity in its ability to remain as intelligent as it is approachable; even as it defies the usual indie conventions about a sad man meeting a sad young girl; Columbus is a handsomely crafted achievement.
425,20170036,Visually arresting and replete with contemplative moments; Columbus spotlights the eponymous Indiana town... Exquisitely rendered by cinematographer Elisha Christian; the otherwise quotidian structures of banks; libraries; and hospitals all become seen.
426,20170036,This is one of the year's most interesting and captivating works.
427,20170036,"A calmly paced; contemplative movie; Columbus is regularly compared to Richard Linklater's trilogy of ""Before"" films; all of which feature little but a couple talking."
428,20170036,The quietly stirring; exquisitely photographed Columbus is an art house gem that beautifully illuminates not only the architecture of a small Indiana town; but also the characters who inhabit it.
429,20170036,The movie's framings are uncannily beautiful. They remind us that films; like buildings; are formed by squares and spaces that catch light and shadow. The dialogue is a wonder too.
430,20170036,Brainy and sensual; cool and emotional; this wildly impressive feature debut is a coming-of-age drama that consistently defies expectation.
431,20170036,This is a challengingly intelligent film; and Richardson is just superb.
432,20170036,Imperfect; but more than enough to put Kogonada on the map.
433,20170037,A stunning work of curation from documentary filmmaker Morrison; a story of fortune; folly; film and fire preserved in permafrost.
434,20170037,If cinema is the place where dreams meet reality; then Dawson City: Frozen Time is a cinematic reverie that takes us on a mesmerizing and deeply moving journey through history
435,20170037,A story of fire and ice; silver and gold
436,20170037,Dawson City: Frozen Time's most intense quality is its richness; both visually and historically.
437,20170037,In carefully molding these relics; Morrison is less a traditional filmmaker than he is a sculptor... The slow-moving; warped; scratched images seem emulsified in scotoma.
438,20170037,A heart-felt love letter that confirms how even time cannot stop the transformative power of an art form still very much in its infancy.
439,20170037,"The thrilling documentary ""Dawson City: Frozen Time"" is indescribable not because it's ambiguous (it's totally straightforward) but because it does so many things so beautifully it is hard to know where to begin."
440,20170037,Bill Morrison; whose extraordinary documentary Decasia turned decomposing film stock into the stuff of avante-garde reverie; returns with another staggering journey into the past.
441,20170037,"In ""Dawson City;"" Morrison offers a fiercely precise and discerning look at movies themselves as embodiments of history."
442,20170037,"The true magic that ""Dawson City"" captures is; simply; the mystery of film itself: a medium that turned people into shadows that burned brighter than life."
443,20170037,We come away with a contemplative suspicion that we're all participating in something; and even if we don't ever get to see the big picture; there probably is one and it might even make sense.
444,20170037,Morrison goes on to concoct a fascinatingly alternate history of the early 20th century; far too complex to recount here. It's all made even more compelling for being presented with no voice-overs; only a mesmerizing score from Alex Somers of Sigur Ros
445,20170038,Bright Lights: Starring Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds is an exploration of this unusual relationship and a celebration of the beautiful lives left behind.
446,20170038,"Many of those mourning the deaths last week of ""Star Wars"" icon Carrie Fisher and her mother and Hollywood legend Debbie Reynolds feel as if they've lost good friends. The HBO documentary ... helps explain that grief."
447,20170038,For 90 minutes; we forget they're gone; spending valuable time with two very different but well-bonded and equally charming Hollywood icons.
448,20170038,A gentle; minor tribute to one of Hollywood's greatest loves that proves how lucky we were to have them; and how much luckier they were to have each other.
449,20170038,So many surprises and revelations; this intimate visit in their homes and heads is pure genius and a wonderful tribute to these ladies who clearly were the loves of each other's lives.
450,20170038,Beneath the glitz and glamour; Bright Lights told a story of family wounds that run deep - a tale we mere mortals can relate to as well.
451,20170038,No matter how unsinkable you are; no matter how hard you try to use The Force; it's impossible to look at that image of mother and daughter; fiercely by each other's sides; and do anything other than cry.
452,20170038,Bright Lights is a much better way to remember them. It wasn't supposed to double as a requiem; but who knew at the time?
453,20170038,Bright Lights plucks [Fisher's] star and that of her mother down from distant heights and lets us gently hold them for a time; reassuring us that their brilliance and humanity was real; their mutual endearment unbreakable.
454,20170038,The film transcends utility. It's a sober yet gracious cautionary tale about fame and fandom and a powerful portrait of love in action.
455,20170038,This is the film we have - one that is likely to leave those who loved Reynolds or Fisher loving them even more.
456,20170038,Ms. Fisher is brainy and salty and hilarious; and she's frank and eloquent in describing being bipolar.
457,20170039,There is serious work being done in The Work; and much good comes of it.
458,20170039,A tough; loud; emotional thing to experience.
459,20170039,The daring approach of McLeary and Aldous' filmmaking; completely immersive without trying to be invisible or to influence the chain of events; is ... proven to have been a risk worth taking.
460,20170039,[These inmates] know the darkness that exists within them and that they can help quell it in each other while preventing it from consuming outsiders who've yet to act upon it.
461,20170039,I'm glad something so gruelingly powerful came out of that four-day session. Just the sight of seeing these tough-looking guys cheering someone on for pouring their soul out was very touching to me.
462,20170039,The men look inward in the most powerful scenes and come face-to-face with the darkness they find. However; it's the moments afterwards; when they... show love and appreciation that are unexpectedly powerful and uplifting.
463,20170039,"The movie valuably demonstrates how; for some; when it comes to rehabilitation; it's never too late to do ""the work."""
464,20170039,By simply watching the participants talk about their feelings; sometimes in the vaguest of terms; McLeary illustrates how men build strong faades to conceal their pain from others and themselves.
465,20170039,A simple; tense; gritty auditing of a collective unburdening that obviously brings some needed clarity; and the promise of rehabilitation; to some hurt; searching souls.
466,20170039,"Opening an aperture into a process so ego-stripping that it feels unseemly to witness; ""The Work"" is enlightening yet also punishing."
467,20170039,More than just an advertisement for the process depicted; The Work carries a profound; implicit point about a culture that encourages men to bottle up what they feel; then condemns them after those emotions express themselves in violent; destructive ways.
468,20170039,Never has a 4;000-year-old aphorism seemed more devastatingly of the moment. But the results are inspiring: it seems The Work works.
469,20170040,It can move you by its decision not to punch emotional buttons as forcefully as a Hollywood film with the same plotline would.
470,20170040,...Truman is stuck between realism and romanticism; and neither side works completely.
471,20170040,All I need to say...it has a really funny and satisfying ending.
472,20170040,Truman is a movie that looks at some of the saddest parts of life but never lets you lose the warmth of the feeling of friendship.
473,20170040,The plot is simple and has one or two missteps towards the end; but the character development is fantastic; as are the two lead performances.
474,20170040,Poignant without overstepping its bounds; Truman is an enjoyable; if sometimes insubstantial member of the popular disease film subgenre.
475,20170040,"""Truman"" avoids preachiness as scrupulously as it evades certainty."
476,20170040,"There are things in life and art that are simply so beautiful that they must be witnessed; and Darn's performance in ""Truman"" is one of those."
477,20170040,Canine power is far from the only thing the film has got going for it. The actor; Julin; is played by the great Ricardo Darn; an Argentine star with a quick wit and a wry; buoyant presence.
478,20170040,"It sounds paradoxical but; if done right; films about a life ending can be the most life-affirming films you'll see. ""Truman;"" a great success in its native Spain; is definitely done right."
479,20170040,There isn't a mawkish moment to be found; though there are plenty of lovely; humane ones; as well as some that are quite funny.
480,20170040,Not your typical cancer drama anchored in grief; instead a clear-sighted journey that makes demands on one's emotions in the most unlikely ways.
481,20170041,Ford is so gifted at taking old photographs and interviews and making a movie that is always beautiful to look at.
482,20170041,Strong Island becomes a steady stream of revelations perfectly timed to completely transform everything we have just learned.
483,20170041,Yance [uses] the contours of the memoir to finally give his brother the justice that he was denied all those years ago. Therein lies its undeniable power.
484,20170041,I was speechless for a few hours after watching this compelling documentary about injustice and its effect. [Full review in Spanish].
485,20170041,One of the rare films to embrace the full literary possibilities of the cinematic medium; in which the images conjured inside the mind can be just as vivid as the ones seen by the naked eye.
486,20170041,What Ford is trying to do with Strong Island is make his family's history visible once again; to give it the clarity and focus that were taken away. Through this process; the wounds of the past might be healed.
487,20170041,The doc is a demanding; wrenching watch; an important work; if not necessarily one you'd recommend to your friends.
488,20170041,There are questions that circle around themselves; endlessly; providing no broader outlook. However; by the same token; it is that very lack of objectivity that makes Strong Island the experience that it is. It is a very tough film to shake.
489,20170041,Strong builds a poignant; methodical portrait of loss. Telling William's story won't bring him back; but at least it will let the world know he lived.
490,20170041,A view of systemic racism through a highly personal and artistic lens.
491,20170041,It's deceptively simple; but it does so much so well. It's heartbreaking by the end...It's just really; really powerful.
492,20170041,Ford's building blocks are familiar; but this is no call-to-action film or how-to guide for getting answers and moving on.
493,20170042,After the Storm; Kore-eda's latest; is his most accomplished work yet; possessing the sort of weary-eyed clarity into the fears and anxieties that plague dreamers who have failed to blossom from the promise of their youth.
494,20170042,Kore-eda directs in a manner that emphasizes performance over visual style; and the action seems set to the same casual rhythms as real life. But most importantly; he has empathy for his characters.
495,20170042,Japanese auteur Hirokazu Koreeda strikes gold yet again with this superlative and poetic portrait of another fractured family unit.
496,20170042,This is the latest work of acclaimed director Hirokazu Kore-eda; whose filmic signature is the subtle and small-scale character study in the tradition of the late Japanese film auteur Yasujiro Ozu.
497,20170042,The performances of After the Storm are indeed exceptional across the board; including pitch-perfect leading man Abe; as well as Maki; who distinguishes her bitter divorcée role with a crusty; steely impatience.
498,20170042,Beautifully layered; bittersweet and forlorn.
499,20170042,No one makes family melodramas quite like Japanese director Hirokazu Koreeda. His style is deceptively low key and matter of fact even as he deals with seismic moments in the lives of his protagonists.
500,20170042,There is such intelligence and delicacy in Kore-eda's film-making; such wit and understated humanity.
501,20170042,It's a clever; mazy film.
502,20170042,This isn't a weepie but as you realise what's happening you may want to cry.
503,20170042,The miracle of Abe's performance; and indeed of Koreeda's direction; is that; despite everything; you don't actually loathe Ryota as a character. You pity him.
504,20170042,Quiet revelations and fleeting poetry - a lottery ticket; we're reminded; is a piece of a dream - pleasingly ensue.
505,20170043,Despite having plenty of gore; It works because it retains a sense of decency.
506,20170043,You'll be hanging out in a sewer with a bunch of nerds and a scary clown -- and having a blast.
507,20170043,What we are left with feels like a collection of related spooky scenes; with no overarching message other than a rather ham-fisted one about how friendship is great.
508,20170043,Overall; however; we've got ourselves a very solid tale of kids going up against an unspeakable horror...
509,20170043,IT is a handsomely crafted work.
510,20170043,Not just a fairly faithful adaptation of the massive book with a handful of wise adjustments and edits made; but it's an artfully realized work that cares more about establishing characters than simply lining up a series of cheap scares.
511,20170043,It has all the essential ingredients for a superior psychological thriller. Muschietti is the masterchef who knows just how to combine them.
512,20170043,It is a fabulous; top-grade remake and; thankfully; it takes its time. Carefully directed by Andy Muschietti (who proved his chops with the 2013 spookfest Mama) the film is heavy with atmosphere... If only all remakes were made with this kind of care.
513,20170043,It seems aimed at being a rite-of-passage horror movie; much like its predecessor ... and it's the stuff bed-wetting nightmares are made of.
514,20170043,I'll have no trouble sleeping tonight... and that's actually a shame.
515,20170043,It follows a slower pace; which is fitting for a psychological horror.
516,20170043,The serious dramatic themes ring hollow; however; leaving only the paperback boogety boogety to justify the Oscar-bait running time.
517,20170044,Whether you are black; white; or anything in between; Whose Streets? is a captivating and culturally crucial watch.
518,20170044,The depiction of activists cleverly figuring out ways to use what little resources they have in a situation that is heavily rigged against them is what makes the film transcendent because you see how they come from such a personal place.
519,20170044,Few films so concisely and vigorously convey the bottomless passion of a people whose singular want is a measure of humanity
520,20170044,A powerfully intimate look at a city under occupation and a people under siege.
521,20170044,It is a remarkably assured debut for Folayan; who captures the protests with a sense of urgency.
522,20170044,It's an example of the full-immersion style of filmmaking pioneered by doc veteran Frederick Wiseman; but goes well beyond Wiseman in that it's definitely dedicated to African American liberation.
523,20170044,"""Whose Streets?"" marks the filmmaking debut of Folayan and Davis; and it's charged by its personal touch."
524,20170044,Told from the perspective of activists; artists; and residents; Whose Streets? is a commemoration of and tribute to the humans of Ferguson.
525,20170044,"""Whose Streets?"" doesn't pretend to solve any problems; only illuminate those that are happening everyday. It's a documentary that lives and breathes in the here and now."
526,20170044,Folayan and Davis have put together a magnetic look at what it was like to live in that neighborhood; to walk those streets and to experience the eruption that turned everything upside down.
527,20170044,"""Whose Streets?"" illustrates a generational changing of the guard in the rhetoric and aims of social activism; along with a growing impatience and a reliance on tactics that can seem as naive as they are highly visible."
528,20170044,Whose Streets? is an impassioned polemic.
529,20170045,Wickedly delicious!
530,20170045,John Wick 2 delivers action; plenty of guns and a hint of class; providing the necessary action and narrative to develop this growing franchise.
531,20170045,Stahelski's kinetic direction keeps things moving; even if there are way too many shots to the head.
532,20170045,[Keanu] Reeves's Zen-like cool serves him well here. He's like an athlete resorting to muscle memory; lethal and lightning quick as he automatically falls into what he's done best.
533,20170045,John Wick: Chapter 2 isn't just a great action movie. It's one of the best action movies ever made; and it stands alongside other classics like The Raid; Mad Max: Fury Road and Hard Boiled.
534,20170045,The creative team blows open the doors to this secret world and allows viewers inside this dark world where Wick (the appropriately understated Keanu Reeves) made his home... And boy; do they make it fun again.
535,20170045,A sequel is entirely welcome; and Chapter 2 does its job entirely ably; without exactly doing much overtime.
536,20170045,Chapter 2 will pass a Friday or Saturday night as mindlessly as its predecessor.
537,20170045,One fundamental problem is that John Wick is well-nigh indestructible. That means the element of threat simply isn't there.
538,20170045,It is such a hoot; watching him shoot everyone in the nightclub. He shoots them in the face; under the chin; through the temple. Blam! Blam! Blam! Screams! Gore! Death!
539,20170045,John Wick laid out the basics of its codified criminal community; but Chapter 2 builds from them an intricate world that has the claustrophobic quality of any professional industry.
540,20170045,Basically this is a film about nothing; but you could also call it art for art's sake; with some of the most elegant action since the 1980s heyday of Walter Hill.
541,20170046,For a film that focuses on parent-child relations in the wake of a tragic death; Menashe remarkably eschews sentimentality or lazy conjecture.
542,20170046,Though we may not all live in the same community as its characters; the sheer love; commitment; and vulnerability involved are human qualities we can identify with. Let the film shine its gentle light on you and allow you to blossom.
543,20170046,It is a sometimes emotional; eye-opening treatise showing the tough; gray area decisions religious people like Menashe have to deal with in today's world.
544,20170046,This sensibly directed; melancholic little film prizes sincerity instead of overblown melodrama.
545,20170046,Moving and occasionally rather heartbreaking.
546,20170046,Spoken entirely in Yiddish; Menashe is a sort of Kramer vs. Kramer of the Hasidic community in Borough Park; Brooklyn. Played by Menashe Lustig; the titular character proves immediately lovable; if not a mensch.
547,20170046,"The curious are welcome; but this one fits snugly in the category of ""You Don't Have to Be Jewish; But..."""
548,20170046,"""Menashe"" is a little slice of life; delivered with a knowing sense of truth."
549,20170046,Some viewers may have trouble with the fact that Menashe doesn't simply abandon this world that treats him with so little respect; but that's precisely what makes the film so powerful.
550,20170046,Menashe is a deeply felt and absorbing Yiddish-language drama about New York Hasidic Jews.
551,20170046,Whatever pickle he gets himself in; we can't help but root for Menashe.
552,20170046,It's a film that just keeps getting stronger as it goes; unfolding almost imperceptibly and becoming deeper with each scene.
553,20170047,Cristian Mungiu is unquestionably a master dramatist and master commander of cinematic grammar; and Graduation is one of the most formally accomplished films of recent years.
554,20170047,Mungiu knows Romania is in sore need of critiquing. The weird thing is; Graduation provides no excitement from such a critique.
555,20170047,Graduation resists easy resolutions or satisfying conclusions. It's a cinematic moral conundrum; raising numerous questions and answering very few of them.
556,20170047,The times in which emotion breaks through (as it certainly did in 4 months) are the times you should be sure you are paying attention.
557,20170047,An intelligent; elegant; morally ambiguous; and quite frankly brilliant tale of corruption and questioning whether it can ever be justified.
558,20170047,For those with the patience; GRADUATION does have something to say.
559,20170047,To Mungiu's credit; he makes it clear that; although the film is set in Romania; its moral quandaries could be taking place anywhere.
560,20170047,Writer-director Cristian Mungiu continues his expert evisceration of his native Romania; and by extension; this whole rotten world and the people who make it that way; even as they convince themselves otherwise.
561,20170047,It feels like nothing's happening until you realize everything is; right before your eyes.
562,20170047,It's ... insistent that life is a series of complex decisions; with fate intruding; and the path's never clear.
563,20170047,The cinematography; the dialogue and the performances; especially Adrian Titieni's as an earnest and anxious Mr. Fix-It; are impressively naturalistic.
564,20170047,Those who have followed [Mungiu's] work may be better prepared for this new drama and its slow; deliberate pace.
565,20170048,To strip the preconceptions away and simply watch as a family prevails against the stacked deck their country sustains to keep them down is to see an honest slice of America.
566,20170048,The gentle; persistent rhythm of the film's pacing subtly underlines the family's continual push forward against all odds and since you feel so incredibly lucky to spend any time in their company.
567,20170048,[The Raineys are] fascinating subjects to say the least and director Jonathan Olshefski couldn't have made them more interesting if he'd written them.
568,20170048,Moments like these speak to people's basic humanity and; combined with the Rainey clan's refusal to suffer defeat; give us reason to be optimistic.
569,20170048,Filmed over the course of approximately a decade; this powerful and poignant picture moves well beyond its original niche.
570,20170048,The filmmakers are content to allow us to spend time with these people; they recognize the power of connection and compassion.
571,20170048,Quest speaks volumes about working-class life and the necessity of community; parenting; perseverance; speaking out; speaking up; hope.
572,20170048,Olshefski captures the frustration; resignation and determination that leaves you struck by this family -- average in their concerns but extraordinary in their dedication to one another.
573,20170048,Through eight years of filming ... the director discovers an everyday American story of extraordinary strength.
574,20170048,"""Quest"" could very easily have been titled ""An American Family"" as well."
575,20170048,There is no grand narrative or point to be hammered home; instead; Olshefski delivers a subtle; sincere and honest portrait of barely making ends meet in modern America.
576,20170048,Tthe family members - Quest; his rock-solid wife; Christine'a; and their teenage daughter P.J.; who gains in character and complexity as she grows up before our eyes-are too individualized to represent anything but their own determination and decency.
577,20170049,This summer's mega-budget blockbusters can't pack the cathartic punch provided by the most satisfying moments in Step's triumphant third act. And this is real life.
578,20170049,It's not unreasonable to assume that the title doesn't refer to this chosen form of dancing as much as it refers to the steps each girl must take if she wants to break free from her surroundings and escape into the world at large.
579,20170049,Step is one of those documentaries that both fascinates and uplifts.
580,20170049,Step isn't just a documentary; it's an empowering and rapturous celebration.
581,20170049,There's plenty of goodness in this world and Step is a potent reminder of what it looks like and what it can accomplish.
582,20170049,The reason Step works so well is that you can actually see life paths shifting before you eyes. They put in the work on and off the team; and the results happen.
583,20170049,"Step is a superlative entrant into the particular modern genre of film-making known as: ""Tear-jerking and life-affirming documentary..."""
584,20170049,Inspiring and uplifting.
585,20170049,The film is perhaps not entirely candid about all the bad stuff backstage; and there are complex personal issues that are not entirely absorbed. But a very likable film.
586,20170049,Director Amanda Lipitz takes viewers home with the students and creates palpable drama around their quests to attend college following their senior year.
587,20170049,Step is a story about relationships. And how even the most challenging family ties shape us into the people we are destined to become.
588,20170049,The portrait of the girls; their hard-up but loving parents (two are single mums; men being conspicuous by their absence) and the school staff egging them on is in turns saddening and lovely; the drama of their collective effort intensely moving.
589,20170050,Initially starting as a charming portrayal of American eccentrics; with a dose of Woody Allen-esque humour riddled by anxiety and neuroses; the film eventually grows more depth as it explores a topic rarely discussed in society.
590,20170050,We live in an anxious age of irony and increasing rancor; and if earnest antidotes seem too easy to dismiss; just try to resist Dina; a documentary about a middle-aged autistic couple. It may be the year's best documentary; and the best rom-com.
591,20170050,... a film about the universal drama of watching a relationship mature.
592,20170050,There is a rare mix of raw intimacy and artifice to Dina; with obvious camera set-ups and movie-like music cues but also amazing moments of tenderness; humor and candor.
593,20170050,In telling their story in such a beautiful way; Sickles and Santini seem to realize how precious what Dina and Scott have before they do; but then again; it's hard not to fall for Dina; or her film.
594,20170050,The result might be a poignant; morally ambiguous and awkwardly engaging love story - replete with the knowledge that this is just another brave month in her life.
595,20170050,Powerful film-making; executed with subtle style.
596,20170050,Co-directors Antonio Santini and Dan Sickles tell the story gracefully; doling out Dina's tragic backstory in excellent increments.
597,20170050,There are moments of humour in a gently affecting story that celebrates the ordinariness of its subjects.
598,20170050,Dina is a story about resilience and a woman's indomitable will to seek out her best life.
599,20170050,Sweet without being sappy; the film extends an uncommon empathy to two characters that colder films (and; as we see; people) would treat as a punchline.
600,20170050,Filmmakers Antonio Santini and Dan Sickles mostly let the couple's routines and journeys paint their own emotionally dappled picture.
601,20170051,Those of us who love horror films that reflect societal issues should support it; no matter how much we may risk dry heaving in the process.
602,20170051,Raw is a new classic of gross-out horror; but it's also a finely tuned psychological piece about a disorder that affects millions of women.
603,20170051,It plays out slowly; with creeping dread that does not disperse even with the closing credits.
604,20170051,Raw is both endearing and brutal with Ducourau's masterful character development and visceral pleasures.
605,20170051,RAW is vibrant; violent and vivaciously grotesque.
606,20170051,It's easily one of the most disgusting films I've ever seen; but it's also the most thematically rich cannibal film you're apt to find.
607,20170051,Raw ... exposes the everyday monstrousness each of us harbours within our soft; fragile exteriors; and the accommodations we have to make with our darker nature.
608,20170051,The shock tactics can verge on the prurient but even in the most extreme moments; the film never loses sight of character.
609,20170051,The plot lurches from gross-out to gross-out with little wit and less logic.
610,20170051,Its power - its shuddering; relentless intensity - lies in the way it makes you vicariously feel both her dual hungers; and surreptitiously relish every sticky; illicit bite.
611,20170051,The intelligent; deliciously repellent Raw stays with you long after the sight of a nice trainee vet snacking on a fellow student's severed finger has gone.
612,20170051,Ably assisted by Marillier - and Ella Rumpf as Justine's controlling sis - Ducournau captures the more quotidian dread of fitting into cliques; losing your virginity and living up to family expectations.
613,20170052,Visual splendor without a narrative shell.
614,20170052,It's just a gorgeous lovely film.
615,20170052,Dudok de Wit doesn't just know how to create beautiful images; he knows how to pull them together for tension and heartbreak as well. Sadly the story he's illustrating isn't anything like as inspiring as his animation.
616,20170052,Without the help of dialog; musical numbers or flashy visuals - indeed; the entire effort borders on the monochromatic - THE RED TURTLE becomes a hypnotic experience.
617,20170052,The simple but spectacular beauty of 'The Red Turtle'; also resides in its spectacular artistic zone; which accentuates the emotions that the film raises. [Full Review in Spanish]
618,20170052,Dudok de Wit manages to find wonderful drama and humor in the island's smallest details.
619,20170052,It's a superb piece of work; beautiful and enigmatic.
620,20170052,The experience is captivating; transcendental even.
621,20170052,One for the desert island films list.
622,20170052,The Red Turtle is a dialogue-free love story; strange and sparingly supernatural.
623,20170052,Small children often experience the world as simultaneously solid and fantastical; De Wit's beautiful film tugs us into that mindset.
624,20170052,The images are tamely drawn; the tale is wanly evolved.
625,20170053,Though the film as a whole is confused and convoluted; Katabuchi leaves us with a hopeful conclusion and worthy salute to the power and sanctuary of the imagination.
626,20170053,The brilliance of this film is that it depicts a world where its people were far removed from the war that this country was actively a part of until they themselves are attacked.
627,20170053,Like many other anime features; this one isn't exactly for the kids. Then again; it can't be any more detrimental to young minds than something like The Emoji Movie.
628,20170053,The movie opts for the lack of point of view. Interpretations must be made by the viewer; who attends a spectacular graphic exercise outside the conflict it represents.[Full Review in Spanish]
629,20170053,In This Corner of the World uses its World War II story and spellbinding protagonist Suzu to create a powerful depiction of war beyond the high-stakes dramatics of the battlefield.
630,20170053,Thoughtful and creative in the telling of this chapter of world history from a unique perspective; In This Corner of the World is a film for the whole family.
631,20170053,The painterly beauty of anime detaches the viewer from the terrible events depicted; but it also makes these cataclysms more accessible to the imagination.
632,20170053,[Suzu's] life is treated as thoroughly unexceptional ... except of course it isn't. Besides a heart full of (hesitant) love and a soul full of (bashful) virtue; she has the artist's drive to capture the passing world
633,20170053,"""Corner"" is a deeply sympathetic tale; using the possibilities of animation not just to pique curiosity; but to devastate."
634,20170053,From the casualties-of-war file comes a gorgeous-looking animated feature from the writer-director Sunao Katabuchi.
635,20170053,An elegant reminder that we can never forget what life during wartime does to the human soul.
636,20170053,It has jaw-droppingly gorgeous settings; in which all the buildings are depicted with full accuracy; as are the homes of the peasant families who live on a mountain slope; overlooking the (largely wooden) city.
637,20170054,Noah Baumbach's most accomplished work to date.
638,20170054,Little clever details are the ones that end up shaping compelling characters and recognizable dynamics between them; and that's the essence of the film. [Full review in Spanish]
639,20170054,But for a film that fumbles its last act like a greased football; it still remains a funny; penetrating look into familial dysfunction.
640,20170054,Depicts with ups and downs the gathering of an estranged; dysfunctional family.
641,20170054,A hilarious and poignant portrayal of a broken family; The Meyerowitz Stories is truly sublime.
642,20170054,"Probably deserves better than to be hailed as ""the good Adam Sandler film on Netflix""."
643,20170054,There's a certain air of melancholy that hangs over the film; permeating every frame with a sense of missed opportunity and a lifetime of buried feelings.
644,20170054,I think we are before the best work of Baumbach; the most mature and complete to this date. [Full Review in Spanish]
645,20170054,[The Meyerowitz Stories] feels very much like a wacky; dysfunctional family trying to find it's way like The Royal Tenenbaums for a new generation.
646,20170054,Loud but vapid [and] distinctly petty.
647,20170054,Long-standing feuds and petty squabbles often ring true and when they don't; they are entertaining enough to keep the audience invested.
648,20170054,The things that this family focuses on and obsesses over may drive you nuts. But it's an honest and true profile of a family that is in crisis but has learned to navigate it rather than fix it.
649,20170055,Loach does not need much time or narrative resources to show us how the system seems orchestrated to break the dignity of those who do not have privileges. [Full Review in Spanish]
650,20170055,I; Daniel Blake is a deeply moving and; sadly; much-needed reminder of everything that's wrong with Britain's benefits system and a man's right -- and defense of his fight -- to be treated as a human being by the state that has devised it.
651,20170055,The emotional impact of the film lies in its raw; documentary feel and the natural performances of Johns and Squires; the dialogue is akin to eavesdropping on real conversations.
652,20170055,An uncomfortable; unpleasant truth; which certainly does not invite the consumption of popcorn; but cinema can be more than entertainment. And sometimes it should be. [Full Review in Spanish]
653,20170055,[A] deeply moving portrait of poverty and human dignity.
654,20170055,A touching story; and a deflating one.
655,20170055,It's enough to make you want to scream; except you don't have to scream. Ken Loach does the screaming for you.
656,20170055,Brims with spirit; sympathy and candor as it tackles the catastrophic displacement brought on by economic and technological change.
657,20170055,Johns makes it all bearable. Inviting; even. His performance has such a gentle humanity; even (especially) in the darkest scenes that you can't turn away.
658,20170055,Writer-director Ken Loach has been making movies about the British working class since the mid-60s; and this masterful dramatic feature proves that even after all these years he can still work himself up into righteous; white-hot rage.
659,20170055,Politically; of course; it cleaves to the left; yet by temperament it shrinks from progress.
660,20170055,Whichever side you come down on; Johns' and Squires' low-key performances are impressive; and the technological/red-tape hurdles their characters face feel stingingly accurate.
661,20170056,A picaresque tour of the grandest people's palace of all: the New York Public Library system.
662,20170056,"A documentary about a library that's longer than Titanic is never going to be a major hit. But what Wiseman achieves here is both beautiful and extraordinary."""
663,20170056,More than a building full of books.
664,20170056,...Wiseman captures the variety of people who use the library; and the variety of purposes it serves in the life of the city.
665,20170056,In one of Wiseman's finest modern works; we are reminded of the democratic nature of libraries; and how all religions; political ideas; races and classes are represented on equal footing within.
666,20170056,An extraordinary portrait of the institution in the present time and looking towards the future. [Full review in Spanish]
667,20170056,Ultimately Ex Libris demonstrates that libraries are about people; and what gives the film its great and accumulating force is that people are infinitely complex.
668,20170056,Three-hours-plus is an absurd amount of time to sit through the visual equivalent of thumbing through the NYPL's program guide.
669,20170056,If only all study sessions were as enchanting as this.
670,20170056,Nonetheless; this is a fascinating and painstaking piece of work which provides an extraordinarily thorough picture of its subject.
671,20170056,For the last half-century; Wiseman has never stopped looking outward. But this could be his unwitting self-portrait.
672,20170056,Hypnotic and illuminating.
673,20170057,The film succeeds in the more basic sense by surveying a complicated woman's existence. It also does so without diminishing the intimate details that help audiences relate to Lamarr's complexity not just as an icon; but as a human being.
674,20170057,This is a terrific introduction to a fascinating life.
675,20170057,A witty; fascinating and sometimes melancholic biography of a clever; complex and beautiful woman. It rattles along at an impressive pace; with a drive and verve of which inventor and Hollywood actress Hedy would surely have approved.
676,20170057,The documentary is informative and thoroughly engaging with its narrative fluidity.
677,20170057,"By coloring Lamarr's life story in with shades of gray rather than distilling it to the black and white of ""film star"" or ""inventor"" or the like; a full picture of the woman-inquisitive; talented; flawed-comes into focus."
678,20170057,Director Alexandra Dean gets the most out of a peculiar mix of on-camera interviews; archival footage and recently discovered audiotapes of Lamarr explaining herself posthumously.
679,20170057,A vivid portrait of one of the most remarkable; pioneering women of Hollywood's Golden Age.
680,20170057,If her story; however; is even vaguely familiar (made nude flick; was brainy; did inventions; made glamour flicks; stayed brainy; had lots of plastic surgery; died) then this will be a very ho-hum trawl.
681,20170057,Lamarr was an enigma: a great brain trapped in a silly; spurious image of glamour; while her real talent was allowed to wither. A sad but fascinating story.
682,20170057,It's a reminder that; even for world-famous icons; it's pointless to reduce people to a single piece of notoriety.
683,20170057,A fascinating documentary about Hedy Lamarr; an extraordinary woman who was so much more than the moviegoing public ever imagined.
684,20170057,Not your usual silver-screen documentary.
685,20170058,What upends The Last Laugh is that the scenes with Firestone; which take up a good percentage of the screen time; follow the template of scores; if not hundreds; of Holocaust-survivor documentaries.
686,20170058,Pearlstein asks the big questions; and sometimes the answer is a tear; sometimes a laugh; and always profound.
687,20170058,The Last Laugh is thought provoking in its analysis of both the cultural identity of the Jewish people and the anatomy of a joke.
688,20170058,The Last Laugh doesn't have many answers. But the questions it raises are worth their own sake.
689,20170058,Renee Firestone; a Holocaust survivor now 93-years-old; captures the essence of The Last Laugh; Pearlstein's documentary on the humor coming out of the horror during World War II.
690,20170058,Director Pearlstein makes it easy on us to decide by making the film both hilarious and thought-provoking.
691,20170058,Ferne Pearlstein's The Last Laugh is a rather safe and genteel documentary about the limits of humor (especially as they pertain to the Holocaust); but it opens with a subtly provocative sequence of events that's hard to shake.
692,20170058,At times haphazard but always involving ...
693,20170058,At a time when many of us look to comedy to keep us sane; the question is especially pertinent; although the answers here aren't especially penetrating.
694,20170058,Is laughter a palliative? The only weapon of the powerless? Perhaps significantly; the film ends in tears.
695,20170058,"In its own way; ""The Last Laugh"" is a celebration of Jewish humor; not just its importance as a survival technique; but also just how much it has shaped our culture."
696,20170058,An eye opener in every sense
697,20170059,As nationalist fervour and racism strengthens in modern-day Hungary; it is admirable that 1945 has been made at all.
698,20170059,Handsomely shot in black and white and just 91 minutes; Torok's picture does not linger long; yet it manages to say so much that matters.
699,20170059,Marvellously directed and acted; 1945 shows how those who practice deception for their own ends are likely to pay the price and in ways they may not foresee.
700,20170059,The film's straightforward but effective narrative holds few surprises while the talented cast strengthens the storytelling especially Péter Rudolf who makes a smooth transition from comedy to drama.
701,20170059,The darkness of wartime reaches not only into one day in August. In this muted but powerful film; Török is also commenting; obliquely but effectively; on the rise of far-right nationalism and anti-Semitism in present-day Hungary.
702,20170059,1945 is a brilliantly made film; and powerful; moving reminder of the evil that can take place under cover of wartime and the power of greed.
703,20170059,Features an intrusive sound design; including Tibor Szemzö's jarringly contemporary score and sound effects that include the ringing of a clock tower; buzzing flies; rumbling thunder and noisy birds...
704,20170059,This film adds to a growing list of Holocaust dramas and documentaries that move past the guilt of Nazi Germany to ponder the complicity of smaller communities in eastern Europe.
705,20170059,"A town wracked with guilt must come to terms with the horrors of its war atrocities in ""1945;"" a somber drama set in the immediate aftermath of WWII."
706,20170059,1945 benefits from its leanness. [...] The film's 90 minutes are unhurried but inexorable.
707,20170059,Set in a specific time and place; 1945 also resonates as a story of people doing terrible things to other people in the name of opportunity and getting ahead. It hits home at a time when the idea of loving thy neighbor feels sadly passé.
708,20170059,[A] sombre; accomplished but somewhat heavy-handed work...
709,20170060,First a pioneer and now an icon; Dolores Huerta is above all a woman committed; as ever; to the many causes she has championed throughout her life.
710,20170060,This film is a must for you and your family. [Full review in Spanish]
711,20170060,This documentary's not exactly perfect; but it's thorough; sincere and real and a great primer if you're one of the many to whom her name is unfamiliar.
712,20170060,This well-made documentary goes a way towards righting that wrong in the case of Huerta.
713,20170060,Watch it to celebrate and be inspired.
714,20170060,Using a mix of talking heads and an unprecedented amount of on-the-front-lines footage; Bratt has created a compelling; joyous documentary that takes pains to avoid the hagiographic leanings of similar films.
715,20170060,"""Dolores"" is a fascinating corrective to 50-plus years of American history. It's educational; to be sure; but also exhilarating; inspiring and deeply emotional."
716,20170060,Hagiographic but still lively and informative; this documentary by Peter Bratt shines a spotlight on a historic; relatively overlooked figure...
717,20170060,With Dolores; we're getting the lesson we deserve.
718,20170060,Modern US history gets a bracing rewrite with Dolores...
719,20170060,Using powerful archive material; the film chronicles Huerta's life and triumphs.
720,20170060,[Peter Bratt] deftly edits together archival footage and interviews with Huerta's children; co-workers; collaborators; and Huerta herself. He backs it with a jazz and salsa soundtrack and tells the story with zest and clarity.
721,20170061,A Quiet Person is an excellent drama with a powerful; multi-layered performance by Cynthia Nixon.
722,20170061,"""A Quiet Passion"" is not working to make us understand Emily; for Emily cannot understand herself. This Emily is no heroine; then; but simultaneously a banshee; recluse; jester; charmer and martyr."
723,20170061,It's as alienating as it is engrossing; a lovely and deeply felt evocation of an artist's innermost anguish.
724,20170061,A match made in heaven.
725,20170061,To consider A Quiet Passion as simply a biopic is to reduce its virtues.
726,20170061,A Quiet Passion is a lovely exercise in tone; visual perfection; and stellar performances.
727,20170061,Stick with it; and keep your eyes on Nixon; a still; gentle-voiced presence whose eyes glow like blue embers.
728,20170061,The rich imagery and controlled composition seem alternately to highlight Dickinson's unfettered art and to mock her sadly fettered life.
729,20170061,"It's not easy to do justice to such a beloved; enigmatic artist; but ""A Quiet Passion"" was well worth the wait."
730,20170061,This is a film of subtle beauty.
731,20170061,When one artist makes a film about another artist; you can be reasonably sure the first sees something of a mirror in the second. That's true here in Terence Davies' beautiful; formally demanding and quite searing portrait of the poet Emily Dickinson.
732,20170061,It's a singular life; marred by the fact that Dickinson didn't live to enjoy the admiration her poems now attract. And I can't think of another director with the sensibility to put it on screen.
733,20170062,What stands out in this film is its bravery in demonstrating instability with sympathy. [Full Review in Spanish]
734,20170062,It often feels like there is a great film within Jeune Femme; but it just got lost in the editing suite; the emotional essence of Paula's struggle remains; but it just doesn't hit as hard as it should do.
735,20170062,Progressively devolves into cheap identity politics. Paula becomes a form of clown; reflecting back on a conveniently unnuanced world of patriarchal and bourgeois villainy.
736,20170062,Laetitia Dosch is hypnotic as the 31-year-old heroine of the bracingly peppery French indie drama Jeune Femme (aka Montparnasse Bienvenüe).
737,20170062,Remember the names of Léonor Serraille and Laetitia Dosch...The pair have created a hilarious; touching and magnetic Jeune Femme with Paula; a character you won't be able to forget.
738,20170062,It's a story of maturation and self-discovery that's reflective of life itself in all the ups and downs.
739,20170062,Laetitia Dosch is breathtakingly charismatic. You can't take your eyes off her; even on repeat viewings.
740,20170062,Laetitia Dosch; its star; is terrific as 30-year-old Paula; who seeks life; meaning and happiness (or any combination) after a 10-year affair with an artist-photographer.
741,20170062,Jeune Femme continually surprises us. At times; it is very dark but then the film will take on the guise of a screwball comedy.
742,20170062,It's like a film that Philippe Garrel might have made; although Paula isn't a thousand miles from Agnès Varda's Cléo.
743,20170062,Two mesmerising portraits for the price of one.
744,20170062,Laetitia Dosch gives a wildly funny performance as the red-headed heroine; Paula; whose audacity knows no bounds.
745,20170063,At once a haunting drama; a delicate love story; and a supernatural horror film; Thelma is a captivating picture that burns slow and leaves a lasting mark when pressed.
746,20170063,Anchored by Harboe's deft performance; one that channels both a teenager's aloofness and frustrations while managing to find the maturity to reckon with her new reality; the film is at turns tense and menacing.
747,20170063,Thelma is a wonderfully composed work; one that involves you at a pace of its own.
748,20170063,Thelma is the kind of brooding; emotionally-charged movie that demands your full attention at all times.
749,20170063,An intense treatise on loneliness; repression; and control.
750,20170063,Thelma's story plays out beautifully; even through the pain and sorrow.
751,20170063,"""Thelma"" is tense; thoughtful and beautifully composed ..."
752,20170063,Trier has found a new way to depict and talk about these emotions and experiences that most human beings know and can never really get over. His way is cold; deadpan; extreme; and very Scandinavian; and it's effective.
753,20170063,It's chilly in Oslo; and in this movie; the better to sneak up on you quietly; like an unexpected shiver.
754,20170063,"As a hushed; haunting portrait of a young woman reconciling daughterly duty and her own incipient power; ""Thelma"" feels like a stylish; timely allegory for the present moment."
755,20170063,"""Thelma"" treads the line between the psychological and supernatural; gracefully at first; and then with increasing abandon."
756,20170063,The scary moments are there; but they take patience. And then they take you by surprise.
757,20170064,The B-Side: Elsa Dorfman's Portrait Photography is a minor work by Errol Morris; but it's still the work of a master filmmaker.
758,20170064,"Although ""The B-Side"" is mildly mournful as Dorfman confronts her impending retirement; forced onto her by the death of the Polaroid film she uses; it is a celebration of the ability to freeze time and the pleasure of looking back."
759,20170064,Touching on the importance of friends and family; the temporality of memories; and the photographic process itself; this is a surprisingly light; but sure footed ode to a fellow image maker.
760,20170064,Nostalgia for the frame.
761,20170064,A sweet film that; like an unshaken Polaroid; feels slightly underdeveloped.
762,20170064,It's Dorfman's work that is the real focal point of the film; and there's enough of that featured here to form a complete portrait of a gifted; introspective artist.
763,20170064,You can almost sense Morris smiling off-camera as she pulls each exposure from her file drawers for reminiscing and newfound scrutiny - that's how strong and warm his admiration is for Dorfman and the humble richness of her work.
764,20170064,[An] enjoyable but also profound movie.
765,20170064,Clocking in at a trim 76 minutes; The B-side is as warmly affectionate as its subject; a close friend and neighbor of the director.
766,20170064,A fine-grained (no photography pun intended) look at the way that the development of an artist's style is usually intertwined with the technology and materials that she chooses to embrace.
767,20170064,There's a lot more movie contained within this charming oddity; but only for those who are willing to look deeper.
768,20170064,Dorfman ... makes for a lively and loquacious subject ...
769,20170065,The combination of such a powerful storyline; inspirational heroine and gorgeous art style will surely see an acknowledgement from the Academy and audiences.
770,20170065,Obviously; The Breadwinner speaks to us about the rights of women; but also; and above all; about solidarity and ties when evil is imposed. [Full review in Spanish]
771,20170065,A beautiful and sensible film. [Full Review in Spanish]
772,20170065,The film's poetic aura removes and remains after it ends. [Full Review in Spanish]
773,20170065,Its effective animation; and its solid script are the icing on the cake. [Full Review in Spanish]
774,20170065,Overall; The Breadwinner is a strong debut for Twomey and a beautifully animated adaptation of Ellis' novel.
775,20170065,There's a calmness and clarity to this engaging animation...
776,20170065,A fiery takedown of fundamentalism; bigotry and oppression of all stripes.
777,20170065,The Breadwinner is thrillingly alive with the delicacy; artistry and wit of human touch.
778,20170065,Not the most obvious subjects for a family animation; but The Breadwinner tackles them all with devastating economy.
779,20170065,This is a day-to-day survival story that stirs the heart and fires the imagination.
780,20170065,This beautiful and continually surprising film makes us think about what children can and can't bear.
781,20170066,The film is drained of any particular vitality
782,20170066,A dithering hangout movie - warm and enveloping like the afternoon sun; luxuriating in gliding bike rides and long walks through the woods; easily digestible and easily forgettable.
783,20170066,A hidden gem in this year's Cannes lineup; Olli Mäki offers both visceral boxing thrills and as delightful a love story as you'll see in a film of any genre.
784,20170066,The Happiest Day in the Life of Olli Maki succeeds as a unique endeavor because Kuosmanen elides formula.
785,20170066,An appealing and harmless film that slyly subverts a genre long known for its unshakable touchstones.
786,20170066,There's just something cozy and delightful about the whole thing that has left me glowing in the time since I watched it.
787,20170066,For the most part; that willingness to scale down and not go for the big; dramatic knockout ends up being refreshing. But it also occasionally results in a lack of dramatic urgency.
788,20170066,A lesson for our time? I can only hope.
789,20170066,Mki is played by the small; sinewy; mildly puzzled Jarkko Lahti; the wonderfully warm Oona Airola plays his fiance; Raija. The black-and-white film pays careful attention to period detail and character; and less to the blood; sweat and tears.
790,20170066,How endearing to encounter a sports movie; if it can even be called that; that prints the man instead of his legend.
791,20170066,This is a very small film; with a big heart.
792,20170066,J.P. Passi's hand-held black-and-white cinematography cries out for big-screen viewing.
793,20170067,There is a reason Wind River is gaining momentum. While it can be hard to watch at times; it is a compelling story that envelopes the audience from the opening scenes.
794,20170067,Wind River is as much of a gritty crime thriller as it is a character study. While the former sometimes suffers in service of the latter; the film is; in the end; greater than the sum of its parts.
795,20170067,More predictable than it is a disappointment; Wind River may not be incredibly nuanced; but is more often than not enjoyable.
796,20170067,The acting is strong; the characters complex and the story realistic.
797,20170067,podcast review
798,20170067,It's an exercise in great storytelling; character development; superior acting; and establishing a sense of location that brings us unsettlingly close to facing our own prejudices.
799,20170067,A terrible shame to use such an interesting setting for such a conventional story.
800,20170067,In its marriage of man and landscape; Sheridan's film is like an Anthony Mann Western remade. It's a Naked Spur gone snowy; a Far Country gone far; feral and scenically tremendous.
801,20170067,Wind River is a smart and very satisfying movie.
802,20170067,It's an American thriller that will certainly appeal to fans of Scandinavian noir.
803,20170067,A curious but ultimately humane story of brutality and grief on a vast Native American reserve in Wyoming.
804,20170067,Wind River ticks all the right boxes. It also leaves a bad smell.
805,20170068,The film is effortless in its mainstream appeal however as it tackles a worthy subject without beating it over the head of its audience.
806,20170068,For a story that's just as depressingly relevant in 2017*** as it was in 1973; this film should be a lot more than simply pleasant.
807,20170068,I found this movie to be completely blah.
808,20170068,I found it way too slow.
809,20170068,Unspooled in a straight-forward biography style by Dayton and Faris; Battle of the Sexes is an easy watch that provides a smattering of insight and a transportive amount of love for the decade.
810,20170068,Battle of the Sexes is a glorious live-action cartoon of a movie that should score both at the box office and awards season.
811,20170068,A fascinating story; rendered in broad; middlebrow strokes.
812,20170068,Carell; terrific and a little horrific; gets him exactly. He wins the film; though we won't reveal the match outcome.
813,20170068,In a performance tinged with comedy and pathos; Carrell captures Riggs's sleaziness; his chutzpah and his childlike quality.
814,20170068,A seductively enjoyable; smart and well-acted film ...
815,20170068,Watching male chauvinism get a drubbing will never not be good cinematic sport; and Battle of the Sexes gives us ringside seats.
816,20170068,Stone gives her best performance since she first exploded as a fully formed generational talent in 2010's Easy A.
817,20170069,It's filmmaking at its finest. [David Gordon] Green takes a seemingly uncinematic story and turns it into a poetic film that begs to be watched.
818,20170069,It's a good film with many layers about someone like you and me who worked hard learning that when you think you can't; you can.
819,20170069,This is no shallow; feel-good story. Bauman finds his way forward; but the audience sees the experience isn't just hard; it's excruciating. Sometimes just choosing to get up another day is heroic.
820,20170069,Talk about a winner! Jake Gyllenhaal's gritty; multifaceted Oscar-worthy performance gives us a realistic and profound sense of what it means to be a true hero.
821,20170069,Stronger is a very standard affair: Every beat can be seen from a mile away.
822,20170069,Gyllenhaal and Maslany are extraordinary playing two people trying desperately to connect on this new playing field.
823,20170069,But the movie shouldn't be dismissed as just another real-life drama to catch on cable TV someday; Stronger is a profound; sensitively made gem.
824,20170069,"Can't a disabled hero; once on screen; not be a hero? Can't he be a human being whose tragedy; even if ""triumphed"" over; probes deeper thoughts and feelings than crass exultation?"
825,20170069,Aside from a few mawkish missteps near the tail end; this film feels like the product of a confident; able and self-aware director.
826,20170069,Stronger is at its best in its harshest moments; when it acknowledges the contradictions in its hero's story and portrays his bitterness and self-loathing as well as his courage.
827,20170069,... stealing the best bits from My Left Foot; Born on the Fourth of July and The Theory of Everything by playing a character who's not quite paralysed; but mostly in a wheelchair and delivering enormous shouty set-piece speeches ...
828,20170069,"It's one of those decent; well-acted; non-revelatory efforts destined to be filed snarkily under ""this had awards buzz"" through no real fault of its own."
829,20170070,This is a film that takes Bridesmaids and Trainwreck up a notch.
830,20170070,It's pretty cool to see a comedy starring black women getting to do all the raunchy; fun humor that usually we see white men do all the time; occasionally black men and that one time we saw white women.
831,20170070,It's frequently filthy fun that provides countless laughs and all the emotions. There's meaning behind the laughs though; a celebratory message of female friendship that will resonate universally.
832,20170070,"Girls Trip has an appeal that goes beyond the limp plot devices and superfluous storylines. There's certainly the ""about damn time"" quality that runs through the whole movie; and a great number of the R-rated jokes land."
833,20170070,This movie is hilarious.
834,20170070,It was really funny. Go see it.
835,20170070,IF you missed the girls-gone-bad comedy of Rough Night earlier this year; don't worry. Go and see Girls Trip instead.
836,20170070,Girls Trip's overriding focus is that of friendship -- in its all its raw; bawdy; compromised glory.
837,20170070,Malcolm D. Lee's exuberant Girls Trip easily outclasses the likes of Bad Moms and Rough Night.
838,20170070,It's able to balance genuine insight with comic punctuation and shameless resolution; they get high and heartfelt.
839,20170070,It's another Bridesmaids-inspired stumble through the tropes of bad-girl comedy; which includes the mandatory set-piece involving the expulsion of bodily waste...and plenty of blue talk; which is now a regular; if not defining; feature of female comedy.
840,20170070,[Tiffany] Haddish is a genius technician of physical comedy; at once subtle and gigantic.
841,20170071,This might be the most pulpy biographical film ever.
842,20170071,It's a moving portrait of the great jazz trumpeter and of the tragedy that befell him; as seen through the eyes of his woman.
843,20170071,For those interested in learning more about the history of the Jazz community; or even for those familiar with Lee Morgan and just want to hear Helen's side of the story; this documentary is enthralling from start to finish.
844,20170071,A touching and poetic portrait of a pair of imperfect people; forever transformed by the vices of success; the big city and other all-too-human temptations.
845,20170071,There has not been a penetrating and provocative documentary in my recent memory that chronicles with such curiosity; the insight and intimacy into the musical process and romantic partnership disillusionment
846,20170071,The interviews done with Lee's friends hit a genuinely personal tone effortlessly; which is beyond doubt one of the director's greatest merits.
847,20170071,Collin's approach to this incendiary material is both blatant and oblique - a bit like Lee's playing itself. Thankfully; we hear quite a bit of that playing in the film.
848,20170071,"""I Called Him Morgan"" works as a jazz documentary as well as a bizarre true crime tale about a mysterious crime of passion. All these years later; many questions remain."
849,20170071,Ultimately; Collin's film is one of forgiveness.
850,20170071,Collin's exceptional; atmospheric film avoids the hysteria and hyperbole of similar true crime documentaries to usher this delicate story in with a palpable sense of sorrow rather than a desire to retroactively point the finger of justice.
851,20170071,It's Helen's story that truly fascinates.
852,20170071,I Called Him Morgan is a first-rate documentary. It's also the perfect impetus to explore Morgan's catalogue.
853,20170072,A perfectly crafted thriller that uses an extreme circumstance to enclose us in a very humane conflict. [Full review in Spanish].
854,20170072,It Comes At Night is a riveting; emotional affair whose frustrating nature mirrors the frustrations of the human condition.
855,20170072,Like many of the current crop of art horror films; director Trey Edward Shults's film has a strong social subtext. Like most zombie movies; it's about what happens when society fails and it's every man and woman for themselves.
856,20170072,The performances are excellent across the board; with one truly impressive standout. As the 17-year-old Travis; Kelvin Harrison Jr. is the audience identification character.
857,20170072,It Comes at Night couldn't be less interested in playing into [horror] tropes... instead choosing to use our knowledge and expectations of the form to keep us asking the right questions while wondering if we even want the answers.
858,20170072,Shults has taken a very personal story of loss from his own life and turned it into a source of suspense and fear that feels natural and honest; making it into the smartest and scariest horror film of the year.
859,20170072,Think of Shults's film ... as the end of the world by lantern light: intimate and flickering up close; with unfathomable blackness beyond.
860,20170072,It's not exactly scary but it made me so tense I could hardly breathe; let alone think.
861,20170072,The film feels more like an indie art film than a generic shocker.
862,20170072,"The ""It"" of the title refers to the contagious disease that has devastated the outside world (a world that; like much in this beautifully minimalist film; we never see); but it also denotes something even more virulent and destructive: human fear."
863,20170072,The characters' behaviour rings true; the tension is strong and the oily darkness of it all looks good.
864,20170072,It Comes at Night is a handsome low-budget effort in which cinematographer Drew Daniels turns his liabilities into assets.
865,20170073,In an account full of eye-opening scenes; the film gives us a knotty; balanced idea of the moral quandaries involved.
866,20170073,Trophy is not a pleasant experience; but it is necessary.
867,20170073,The stakes are high; so it's worth considering all points of view. Thanks to the even-handed; illuminating approach of directors Christina Clusiau and Shaul Schwarz ... ; we can.
868,20170073,In the style of a Louis Theroux documentary; Trophy's filmmakers give us extensive insight into the hunters' reasoning for doing things some of us might think cruel and even disgusting.
869,20170073,However; the new documentary; Trophy...suggests that not only is the issue of hunting vs. conservationism not so black-and-white; but that the two [are] intertwined.
870,20170073,It behooves those of us with curiosity; a conscience; and a desire to find solutions to pay attention. The documentary Trophy asks us to consider one such issue; and as such is worth a little discomfort.
871,20170073,Trophy doesn't tell you which side to pick; it's content to show you what they are.
872,20170073,It's a film to raise your blood pressure.
873,20170073,Shaul Schwarz and Christina Clusiau's disturbing documentary digs into the murk of the African big-game trade with candour and even-handedness.
874,20170073,A powerful film; but also sometimes very tough to watch.
875,20170073,If 'Blue Planet II' is a bit too touchy-feely for you; this hard-hitting doc should do the trick.
876,20170073,Schwarz and Clusiau also come across as glib storytellers; cutting impatiently between several different stories and presenting them in bite-size chunks; as in a TV news broadcast.
877,20170074,The superb ensemble of veteran Israeli actors; singers and comedians gives bravura performances.
878,20170074,"The Women's Balcony resolves its central conflict a bit too quickly and neatly; but the theme of battle for the soul of a community resonates - at least with many American critics; who have praised the movie's ""universal"" themes."
879,20170074,The Women's Balcony is a feel-good; crowd-pleasing comedy that depicts what happens when extremism and traditional values collide.
880,20170074,The film has crafted an essentially benevolent comic universe where everyone is goodhearted - or at least; they are who they are; and there's not much to do about it.
881,20170074,Their vibrant determination finds expression in a silent sequence shot from above; as each leaves a building one at a time; opening a different-colored umbrella in the rain; resolute.
882,20170074,It's a brilliant uplifting film with a soul and really does show the importance of respect.
883,20170074,Director Emil Ben-Shimon creates a bustling sense of community and injects most scenes with a surprisingly breezy air.
884,20170074,With an eye for artful detail; director Emil Ben-Shimon orchestrates a resolution both plausible and jubilant.
885,20170074,It's impossible to resist a film that has such rich characters; and makes a complicated subject both enlightening and entertaining.
886,20170074,"In the end; the solution offered by ""The Women's Balcony"" to end the rancor feels unearned."
887,20170074,Subtly handled by director Emil Ben-Shimon and screenwriter Shlomit Nehama and rendered heartfelt and compelling by an outstanding cast.
888,20170074,The Women's Balcony overlooks nothing when it comes to addressing faith; segregation and sexism in a peppery; entertaining way.
889,20170075,Félicité might feel like two movies in one but both parts are ravishing; both unmissable.
890,20170075,With a brilliantly nuanced performance from Véro Tshanda Beya Mputu; simultaneously sullen; vivacious; coquettish; Félicité is the African riposte to the West's obsession with female portraits.
891,20170075,... these moments provoke a symbolic tenor that magnify a thinly sketched and frankly rote narrative that never seems worthy of these parabolic flourishes.
892,20170075,Félicité is an enlightening tale that details life in central Africa; set in a milieu of a cabaret singer in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
893,20170075,With the newcomer Véro Mputu onboard; Gomis didn't restrain himself from sailing this boat with courage and emotion.
894,20170075,A Kinshasa-set hybrid of kitchen sink drama and dreamy musical.
895,20170075,Urgently expressive in colour and varied in texture; it's a Congolese Mother Courage.
896,20170075,It's a film with seriousness and compassion; though a little lengthy and diffuse. Dramatic storm clouds gather and pass overhead without ever quite bursting into rain.
897,20170075,Beya ... arrives fully formed here as a figure of enormous dignity and warmth; a pillar of resilience who is nonetheless all-too-humanly susceptible to exhaustion; grief and despair.
898,20170075,A heroic; award-winning central performance from the Congolese actress Véro Tshanda Beya Mputu is reason alone to see this often gripping; occasionally infuriating French-language melodrama.
899,20170075,Think High Noon set in Kinshasa and backed by a Congolese beat.
900,20170075,The meandering narrative has a lyrical quality consistent with the many musical numbers.
901,20170076,"20th Century Women is a sun-drenched search for wisdom in changing times that's no less relevant today than it was when Jimmy Carter gave his ""Crisis of Conscience"" speech."
902,20170076,This is not a great movie; but it is another one of [Annette] Bening's great performances.
903,20170076,What did it mean to be born; to grow up in; to die in; the 20th century? Well; it meant a lot of different things.
904,20170076,Mills; to his credit; creates realistic scenarios with natural dialogue; but this also happens to make the movie; well; very boring.
905,20170076,There are so many small tidbits about life; love; and happiness in 20th Century Women that it feels like therapy.
906,20170076,It feels passive-aggressively preachy; vague in its lessons; and overwritten to the point where I was genuinely dreading every moment Bening was gearing up to speak.
907,20170076,You won't see any other film this year that tries as hard to get under the skin of its characters as Mike Mills' 20th Century Women. That's both its glory and what makes it sometimes such a trial.
908,20170076,Eras and generations mingle productively in this film. It's a social-historical mural that exists in flexitime; where America the Beautiful is an eternal and unassailable dream.
909,20170076,Exasperatingly supercilious and smug - unfocused; self-consciously cute; nostalgic and empathetic; but never properly funny. It feels like someone else's long therapy session.
910,20170076,There are louder films jostling for attention out there. This one is the secret treasure of the season; though - crafted with tender precision; and built to last.
911,20170076,It's a nice film with some great moments but Mills' touch is too tentative to make all that talk buzz and hum as resonantly as it should.
912,20170076,Mills doesn't seem able to get an overview away from his own perspective of the time.
913,20170077,Strip the zombies from The Walking Dead and you have something akin to Fingleton's world - a place of desperate foraging and deep-seated distrust.
914,20170077,Anchored in strong performances from all three of the central actors and a filmmaker in great command of his skills; like his characters going back to basics to build a strong foundation for something that will endure.
915,20170077,Every frame is a loaded gun and its dead fun waiting for it all to go off.
916,20170077,In what could be the feel-bad movie of the year; Fingleton presents a gritty future; where the world's oil supplies are depleted and the population has dwindled.
917,20170077,The Survivalist's plot of a man living in a dangerous; post-apocalyptic world after its oil runs out feels deceptively new; but it ends up treading the same ground as countless other films; books and TV shows.
918,20170077,It's an original and stunning debut for writer/director Fingleton.
919,20170077,A post-apocalyptic drama as stripped-down as its title suggests; The Survivalist envisions end times in which each encounter with a new human entails a hard calculus of risk versus advantage.
920,20170077,Both dire and oddly poetic.
921,20170077,Fingleton's spare; striking debut feature takes a minimalist approach to the post-apocalyptic thriller.
922,20170077,"Impressively lean and rigidly controlled; ""The Survivalist"" achieves; at times; the primitive allure of a silent movie."
923,20170077,eerie and masterful ... as riveting as it is morally confounding.
924,20170077,You'll leave completely rapt.
925,20170078,Both [Doug] Liman and [Tom] Cruise saw that humor in [Barry] Seal's operations and project it well. His squirming out of life threatening situations is hilarious.
926,20170078,American Made occasionally amuses and provokes a hearty guffaw or two by its end. As a biopic it's insubstantial; but as a Tom Cruise vehicle it's alright..
927,20170078,A great summer film that deserves to be the 2017 effort from Tom Cruise that everyone remembers; for all the right reasons.
928,20170078,A classic 90s style Tom Cruise movie of fun adventures in the drug smuggling world.
929,20170078,Cruise turns up the douche flow to maximum and it works like a charm.
930,20170078,American Made is riddled with flaws in both its storytelling and some of the performances; but that doesn't stop Cruise from smoothing over a lot of the rougher edges and bringing it together with a rip-roaring performance.
931,20170078,[Tom] Cruise gives his energetic all to the role; but he; too; doesn't seem to be quite aware that Seal was morally compromised far beyond the shallow confines of this film.
932,20170078,The impetuous pace of the film is at one with its moral shamelessness; and; without thinking; we sign up for both.
933,20170078,Without realizing it; American Made is a wincing metaphor for Tom Cruise's movie career-which; come to think of it; is exclusively and embarrassingly American made; too.
934,20170078,One assumes that Cruise got this film made; yet he's a terrible fit for the role: he's always done his best work portraying smart; insightful characters in dramatic stories; but Seal was a yahoo whose sorry escapades are played here for cynical laughs.
935,20170078,"It skitters and jumps; shivers and boot-scoots; never; ever sitting still. You could say it's like ""Blow;"" on well; blow. But there's a breezy sunniness to this film; which looks like a faded snapshot reclaimed from an '80s photo album."
936,20170078,But by the time the movie roared to its shockingly grim; remarkably embittered ending; American Made had won me over.
937,20170079,There is a lot of ground covered in this film about one important month in the fate of the world. Once the film hits its stride; it's as thrilling as any action film.
938,20170079,A naff piece of Middle England patriotic propaganda and historical revisionism. Winston Churchill's early days in office are depicted in nigh-on cartoonish terms.
939,20170079,Gary Oldman is fantastic.
940,20170079,It's definitely watchable.
941,20170079,It may be history; but Darkest Hour doesn't feel like homework. It's vibrant; thrilling; and intriguing all at once.
942,20170079,Make-up does not a performance make; as is proved by Darkest Hour.
943,20170079,"""Darkest Hour"" is a straightforward; day-by-day depiction of world-changing events; told with meticulous simplicity."
944,20170079,Oldman is sheer joy in a role which transcends an otherwise uneven affair.
945,20170079,It's an amazing performance: the only star turn I've seen in which a famous actor visible in nearly every scene would be unrecognisable if we didn't know his name already.
946,20170079,This isn't an uncritical celebration of British bulldog spirit but a nuanced portrait of Churchill at a key point early in the war.
947,20170079,Who wouldn't want to see the Nazis taken to task by George Smiley; Count Dracula and Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg?
948,20170079,Oldman delivers the greatest-hit speeches not just with mastery of cadence but with enough raw power to make the exceedingly familiar sound fresh.
949,20170080,Those easily prone to tears will most likely be unable to contain their emotions in this methodical drama which could best be described as a family friendly tearjerker.
950,20170080,A beautiful tale of fantasy and tragedy that should be shown to kids nowadays. [Full review in Spanish].
951,20170080,Overall; A Monster Calls is emotionally moving; visually stunning and filled with terrific performances.
952,20170080,The animation of the Monster's tales is astonishing; possessing a depth in colour and detail that quite literally takes your breath away thanks their beauty.
953,20170080,A Monster Calls is absolutely essential.
954,20170080,The viewing experience is unlike most other films with level of special effects. The monster featured here is one of those rare CG creations that actually seems to possess a soul.
955,20170080,This is a tough movie that takes on adult issues and doesn't shy away from the grim realities of its subject matter. But that's what makes this grim children's story work. It's a work of lovely darkness.
956,20170080,Too mature to lure in the younger set and too one-dimensional to make much of an impression on adult audiences.
957,20170080,Director J.A. Bayona presents appealing worlds (real and imagined) awash in color and detail; but while his movie and its monster are very interested in exploring and explaining humanity; they don't quite get people.
958,20170080,As the movie rumbled toward its inevitably devastating conclusion; the chief emotion I felt wasn't sadness but annoyance at the dashed grander potential.
959,20170080,The movie delivers its meaning repeatedly to make sure that no one misses the point; its lessons; rendered even more explicitly than the ones in Conor's classroom; are missing only the chalkboard and pointer.
960,20170080,A Monster Calls is an adaptation of a children's book with a title that makes it sound like a horror movie. Neither of these things should obscure the fact that it's the most mature film of the year -- and one of the most moving.
961,20170081,Percy Fawcett's persistence to follow his obsession continually tests his endurance and resolve. It's worth investing the 2 hour and 20 minutes to find out if he really found his lost city.
962,20170081,Grandiloquent; methodical; and fascinating; the new direction is becoming for Gray; who masterfully conjures a mysterious period of anticipation; when the world was uncharted and carried unimaginable secrets in its bosom.
963,20170081,Instead of painting a dapper Indiana Jonesian picture of a valiant white man making friends with the natives and conquering the jungle; it shows Fawcett as self-obsessed.
964,20170081,That the meetings of geographical societies used to be such animated affairs is one of the revelations of James Gray's film. Another revelation is that Gray has amazing classical chops.
965,20170081,It's a little long but just short of being a masterpiece. There is much to love about The Lost City of Z which is one of the best movies of the year so far.
966,20170081,Director Gray strikes a remarkable balance between the family drama; the class and status struggle Fawcett goes through; and the actual explorations; and how different each journey is.
967,20170081,The never-ending jungle proves perfectly suited to the filmmaker's lush; operatic aesthetic; as does the film's central theme of escaping one's background; through whatever means necessary.
968,20170081,There is an unexploitative; unsensational grounding to the whole affair that lends it dignity; but that doesn't quite justify the 140-minute runtime.
969,20170081,Although The Lost City of Z held my interest; it felt like a missed opportunity. Like too many biographical movies; this one tries to do too much.
970,20170081,Miller's riveting; heartfelt portrayal etches a delicate picture underneath the colorful; wild portrait of Fawcett - of the losses suffered at home in service of greater ambitions and fantastical dreams.
971,20170081,You'll leave your scepticism at the door if you're going to have a good time here.
972,20170081,The film ... is too scattershot in its approach to have much impact.
973,20170082,Citizen Jane shows that it is possible to come out victorious-even if said victory is only a Pyrrhic one.
974,20170082,... Everything we argue about today has direct callbacks to the concerns Jacobs raised more than 50 years ago.
975,20170082,Ripe with Jacobs' more relevant than ever before insight and woven with her winningly abrasive personality; Tyrnauer's archive heavy construction is as rich and rewarding as the cities his subject once dreamed of.
976,20170082,Building only anticlimactically; what it needed (ironically) was better planning. This film's message is vital; sadly the film itself isn't.
977,20170082,I'm with her.
978,20170082,A film like Citizen Jane feels quite timely as an illustration of common sense and the truth winning out of unbridled abuse of power
979,20170082,The movie is scored like a thriller; seemingly building to some terrifying conclusion. And; in a way; it does ...
980,20170082,As the world's urban population grows by more than one million every week; so does the resonance of this documentary about a New Yorker who campaigned in the 1960s against the inhuman and brutal scale of new housing.
981,20170082,Jacobs' unrelenting thirst for change stays with you.
982,20170082,Most good documentaries are powered by conflict; and you couldn't ask for a struggle more elemental or relevant to our time than the one chronicled in Citizen Jane: Battle for the City.
983,20170082,She was also one tough cookie who appreciated a good fight. A bit more internal tussle would have both better honored her spirit and made for a better documentary.
984,20170082,Tyrnauer uses a ton of archival footage to tell his story; and brings it in at a brisk 92 minutes.
985,20170083,Scherfig's celebratory film may be well-dressed romantic hokum; but manages to run the emotional gamut and remain delightful nonetheless.
986,20170083,[Gemma] Arterton is so winning as Catrin Cole; she would be reason enough to see the film.
987,20170083,While the plot lacks emotional depth; screenwriter Gaby Chiappe's mild dialogue and Scherfig's dainty direction focus on its inspirational elements... to build a sweet; heart-warming period drama that reminds viewers that there is hope during hard times.
988,20170083,It's a well-told story with exquisite mise-en-scene; costumes; lighting and staging. It'll fill you up with warmth due to its sincerity and intelligence -- acting as a much-needed catharsis for our times.
989,20170083,In a modern era where we're increasingly conscious of the need for and the value of women voices behind the screen; Their Finest reminds us of those who came before and worked silently (often uncredited) to further the feminist cause.
990,20170083,Their Finest shines a succinct; pleasant spotlight on a small portion of the British war effort that I've never seen told before; and it's as fascinating as it is funny and entertaining.
991,20170083,Although the narrative for Their Finest occasionally rambles ... it is by-and-large a stirring drama that incorporates lighter moments with scenes of deeply felt tragedy.
992,20170083,In its modest; largely comic way; it paints an unusually convincing picture of how films are shaped by factors beyond the control of any one individual.
993,20170083,Stories to inspire a nation have long made up a sizable percentage of Hollywood schlock; and Their Finest deserves credit for exploring a woman's role in such an effort.
994,20170083,Scherfig has shot the film in a soft-focus wash of chestnut and sepia tones -- the colours of nostalgia -- and the screenplay catches Evans' tone without being quite as funny as the book; despite Nighy's Ambrose.
995,20170083,I recall that it was moderately likeable but don't really remember why.
996,20170083,The characters' endless revision of the film within the film tends to heighten one's awareness of the compromises that must have gone into the writing of this formulaic piece.
997,20170084,As usual; Ozon was solid behind the camera in a classic (re)tale about remorse; forgiveness; and passion.
998,20170084,Frantz swings the audience constantly between hope and despair for its characters thanks to a combination of winning performances; clever plotting; and stunning visuals. It's a pleasure to watch from beginning to end.
999,20170084,A beautifully crafted; yet somehow distant work that is deeply moving at times; cold at others.
1000,20170084,Few films can announce themselves as succinctly with an opening image as Frantz does.
1001,20170084,For Ozon; Frantz is an intriguing change of pace; a period piece in another language; and with straightforward but evident depth... But you'll be hard pressed to remember much about it beyond the stirring presence of Paula Beer.
1002,20170084,It's a quietly devastating work that follows an unpredictable and touching path that teaches us a great deal about grieving and learning to live again.
1003,20170084,By the end of Frantz we feel we're still waiting for this aching; reticent; glacial drama to begin.
1004,20170084,A much needed but underwhelming ode to pacifism and the futility of war.
1005,20170084,Frantz is the work of a rascal; but a rascal in an unusually reflective frame of mind. Even with its mysteries solved; you can't help but keep turning it over.
1006,20170084,François Ozon is a master at taking apart the French chattering classes; but here he attempts an almost classical piece of film-making in black and white; French and German; a tangled tale of love and friendship.
1007,20170084,"""Frantz"" offers a sympathetic; if dark; look at the awful wake of war; at the cost of institutional violence; as well as the cost of surviving."
1008,20170084,Directed by François Ozon; Frantz's initial gloom is off putting; but the story captures you in surprising ways.
1009,20170085,Lady Macbeth feels like gussied-up exploitation incapable of wringing any actual substance out of its lurid trappings.
1010,20170085,The portrait it makes of men with power in that 19th century of rural England is authentic patriarchal cancer. [Full Review in Spanish]
1011,20170085,I expected a dark period drama - but the film went way past that. This is no Jane Austen piece. Get ready for a truly psychological thriller.
1012,20170085,[A] visceral; yet austere; telling of  as screenwriter Alice Birch delves into the moral ambiguity of 1865; all to exquisite result
1013,20170085,Combined with Alice Birch's blunt and effective screenplay; the result is a nerve-wracking; emotionless drama that delivers across the board.
1014,20170085,Lady Macbeth is understated and devastating in a single breath; and I'm certain we'll be seeing a great deal more of Florence Pugh in the years to come.
1015,20170085,A fascinating portrait of empowerment gone awry.
1016,20170085,Director William Oldroyd delivers a taut and well-paced period drama elevated by Pugh's riveting performance.
1017,20170085,Pugh is a wrecking crew; communicating pure malevolence with a simple glance; but always keeping her composure. She may be evil; but she's first and foremost a lady.
1018,20170085,The brazenness of her actions and opacity of her emotions suggest a tragic heroine in the grand tradition ... but the film lacks the propulsive drive to make her fate moving.
1019,20170085,[Florence] Pugh is mesmerizing.
1020,20170085,To say that the film left me cold isn't a criticism; as that's clearly the intent. And Florence Pugh; who was only 20 when the film was shot; holds your attention as firmly as all the great women of film noir were able to.
1021,20170086,Though there's still plenty in the film that should be lauded - the saturated and claustrophobic cinematography; and potent performances from most of the cast; for instance - it's a film that should be watched with a disclaimer.
1022,20170086,You'll see a well-made piece of cinema from one of the best auteur directors in Hollywood; but is the trauma worth the cost of admission?
1023,20170086,The rage pulsing throughout this movie is one that can spark conversation; engage brain synapses; even cause change. The question is; how much do we want to change; and how many more Algiers will we endure?
1024,20170086,Kudos to Bigelow/Boal for traversing such troubled waters; even if the product; in my estimation; is all bite and little substance.
1025,20170086,After watching Detroit; emotionally-depleted and politically-agitated moviegoers are guaranteed to stumble out of the theatre feeling woke - I'm not so sure about entertained.
1026,20170086,Detroit is as incendiary; pulse-pounding; relevant; and essential a work as you are likely to see this year; and it's easily one of the best films of the year.
1027,20170086,Fascinating but deeply flawed.
1028,20170086,"In its own polemical way; it is very powerful filmmaking but; as storytelling; it is one-dimensional. There is too much ""docu"" here and not enough drama."
1029,20170086,Each actor inhabits their role with a precision and mettle that means even in the depths of confusion; the complex group dynamics are easy to read.
1030,20170086,Detroit comes out of its corner slugging and barely stops. By the end the viewer has a swollen eye; ringing ears and a conviction that the referee should have stopped the fight.
1031,20170086,Detroit becomes a kind of neo-Gothic horror story.
1032,20170086,It's not an easy film to watch but Bigelow's control over every aspect ensures it's utterly convincing.
1033,20170087,There's a remarkably emotional undercurrent through every scene; with tiny details that take the breath away.
1034,20170087,The timing of Gook... seems very relevant; and I urge everyone to see it.
1035,20170087,It was an ambitious project to take on so many complicated themes; and the end result is a good film that is touching and thoughtful.
1036,20170087,Fabricated with both feel-good and unsettling moments.
1037,20170087,Despite an underlying harshness; the film is often light; its playful moments easing the strain of its everyday racism.
1038,20170087,Anyone paying attention to the news knows we still have much work to do before we can all truly get along; and that makes Gook essential viewing.
1039,20170087,Chon's tale is ... praiseworthy; from its beautiful cinematography (by Ante Cheng in her feature debut) to its take on infamous events from a fresh perspective.
1040,20170087,The film isn't perfect - Mr. Chon's wild camera motions seem more undisciplined than electric - but it does find an angle on the riots that hasn't been seen much onscreen.
1041,20170087,Justin Chon looks at bigotry through the eyes of two Korean brothers in L.A.'s South Central in 1992. The result is hardass yet hypnotically beautiful.
1042,20170087,A punchy; freewheeling movie set around the LA riots; shot in black-and-white; with something of Spike Lee's style.
1043,20170087,A progressive; refreshing take on the unseen stories of the LA riots.
1044,20170087,It's witty; stylish and ultimately devastating.
1045,20170088,If the second half of Okja can't quite keep up with the live wire act that is the first; it does serve up a sobering depiction of the carnivorous corporate culture of the day and the cruelty we inflict on animals on a daily basis.
1046,20170088,You may not turn into a vegetarian after watching Okja; but it should give you pause.
1047,20170088,Essentially a pro-animal liberation movie; this becomes a pretty wild ride as the Korean child doggedly pursues the pignappers all the way to New York
1048,20170088,Bong puts together a shiny rollercoaster of a movie; with madcap chase scenes; fart jokes; and a heart-stopping climax that takes viewers inside a slaughterhouse...
1049,20170088,Swinton's corporate boss is something to behold. Her Lucy Mirando is the ultimate imposter and represents how they have taken over the world.
1050,20170088,Okja is a satire on corporate greed and how awful we are. I know people who stopped eating meat after they saw Okja.
1051,20170088,A strange; well-intentioned but heavy-handed girl-and-her-animal story that merely demonstrates Netflix still has a lot to learn about the movie business.
1052,20170088,It's a testament to Bong's sprawling ambition that Okja manages to be so many things at once -- a caustic satire of corporate evil; an intercontinental action/adventure epic; a coming-of-age narrative for the girl.
1053,20170088,It's a sublime tale of the value of humanity; and the horrors we often have to suffer through to hold on to that.
1054,20170088,The best parts of the movie are also the least wacky.
1055,20170088,What makes the jumble cohere; as usual with Bong; is his extraordinary grasp of space and speed; especially in the Korean half of the film.
1056,20170088,Pitch-black satire; heartwarming devotion; over-the-top performance; and subtle drama are engineered into something decidedly (if improbably) delicious.
1057,20170089,At once inspiring and heartbreaking.
1058,20170089,Ai's film; like his art; moves in contrapuntal stanzas between showing the scale of the immigration crisis and its individual victims.
1059,20170089,By making it clear that those who find themselves in these situations are all ordinary people just like us; Ai Weiwei brings home the sheer; unthinkable monstrousness of their predicament.
1060,20170089,Human Flow's primary goals are to create awareness about the refugee crisis and instill empathy for those affected; and the documentary is successful on both fronts.
1061,20170089,[A] movie that is impossible to shake and will hopefully force you to see the world in a very different light. Well worth your time.
1062,20170089,[The refugees'] situation is extreme; the risks dire; and they're real people. Was it obscene to parade them for my consumption; or was my irritation at his constantly inserting himself into the frame like Hitchcock beside the point?
1063,20170089,An ambitious; humane and often shocking cine-essay on the subject of migrants and the 21st century migrant condition.
1064,20170089,Ai Weiwei's magnificent documentary stands as a companion piece to the BBC's series; Exodus: Our Journey To Europe.
1065,20170089,Difficult; but hugely important film-making.
1066,20170089,The scattershot and lengthy documentary doesn't attempt to be a news report...but the cumulative impact of its often haunting images brings home the plight of millions of the world's people.
1067,20170089,Beautifully filmed testimonies that tear at your soul.
1068,20170089,Its dazzling drone photography sends you gliding over vast expanses of ocean and desert yet the film itself leads to the inescapable conclusion that the world is shrinking.
1069,20170090,How many other films; documentary or otherwise; has ever made the finer points of federal financial regulation so interesting?
1070,20170090,Yet the material; with its narrative propelled by the trial's eventual verdict; never amounts to anything especially substantive.
1071,20170090,An important documentary that falls short of being repetitive. [Full review in Spanish].
1072,20170090,Abacus: Small Enough to Jail is nearly a tragedy; the story of a good man brought down despite having the best of intentions.
1073,20170090,"""Abacus: Small Enough to Jail"" is a great documentary about a very appealing story; that highlights the strength of family bonds and immigrant communities"
1074,20170090,Abacus is another example of James' exceptional storytelling and his ability to generate (and sometimes manipulate) emotions in this audience with precision.
1075,20170090,Using drawings and courtroom testimony; James creates a tense courtroom drama out of seemingly dry material.
1076,20170090,Yet again; it is a story of the fat cats and the thin cats - and a reminder of how Milton Friedman's maxim applies to the bank bailouts: socialism for the rich; free enterprise for the poor.
1077,20170090,A sweet and sometimes moving; if ultimately minor; film about a hopelessly inadequate fraud case from 2012.
1078,20170090,When Steve James's documentary suggests that Abacus was the victim of a concerted Establishment plot... it doesn't have quite enough evidence for a conviction; but it is an absorbing study of the court case; the bank and Chinatown itself.
1079,20170090,"""Abacus"" is probably the only film made in the past decade that could get an audience rooting for a bank; but it does just that."
1080,20170090,"The personalities make the picture; and James' camera presence is such that ""Abacus"" never seems to gin up or theatricalize anyone's thoughts or behavior."
1081,20170091,"Like those in the headlines facing the music for their past actions; Jim Carey seems afraid to fully own up to his own horrible behavior. ""It wasn't me! I was possessed by the spirit of Andy Kaufman;"" is basically the gist of his defense."
1082,20170091,What at first seems like a comedic look behind the curtain of Hollywood history builds to become a mesmerizing live-wire examination of the boundaries between artistic expression and sanity.
1083,20170091,Jim and Andy offers invaluable insight into the agony of acting.
1084,20170091,As well as fascinating and affecting; Jim & Andy is very funny; as it should be with its subjects.
1085,20170091,Jim and Andy' is much more than the chronicle of an actor's transformation for a shoot; or even the portrait of an artist's obsession with another; or an analysis of the similarities between them. [Full Review in Spanish]
1086,20170091,A glorified behind-the-scenes doc from the time Jim Carrey interpreted Andy Kaufman in Man on the Moon; this doc has great footage but loses its way trying to pretend is deeper that it actually is.
1087,20170091,Jim & Andy works best as a reminder of the skill level and commitment of its two title performers.
1088,20170091,"... thanks to ""Jim & Andy;"" viewers will come away not just with greater insight about them; but also the pitfalls that potentially face those who beat the odds by turning an open-mic night into a thriving career."
1089,20170091,Smart; appalling and illuminating.
1090,20170091,Smith weaves footage of Kaufman's emergence onto the comedy scene with Carrey's; and suggests that both performers drew from a similar (if not the exact same) well of pain.
1091,20170091,"Jim & Andy finds Carrey in an intriguing place; what he calls ""a quiet; gentle seat in the universe."""
1092,20170091,One of the most powerful metaphors of Jim & Andy is that life itself is a kind of performance.
1093,20170092,Imagine a version of Morgan Sperlock's  Super Size Me in which; instead of merely bloating up; Sperlock entered into an uneasy friendship with an evil clown version of Ronald McDonald; and you'll get a sense of this doc's unexpected depth.
1094,20170092,It's fair; then; to call Icarus a coup for a first-time documentarian; the product of both dumb luck and a strange rapport between Fogel and Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov.
1095,20170092,If you want insight into cheating in sports and the complicated reasons why it happens over and over; Icarus will open your eyes as never before. It is essential viewing for anyone interested in athletics or competitive sports of any type.
1096,20170092,This is fascinating; scary stuff; not the least of which is the bald-faced lies told all around that are delivered as fact. Icarus is the perfect fable for our time.
1097,20170092,The entire film is gripping; giving the audience no-holds-barred access to the biggest sporting controversy of the century; as well as pulling back the newly re-erected iron curtain ever so slightly to see the inner workings of the Kremlin.
1098,20170092,This documentary takes this to a whole other level. It's fascinating.
1099,20170092,The film knows when to abandon this storyline in favor of a far grander and impactful narrative.
1100,20170092,Because the doc kicks into high gear when Rodchenkov enters the picture -- and because Rodchenkov is such a fascinating subject -- one is inclined to forgive Fogel for his false start of a beginning.
1101,20170092,A shocking entry in the conspiracy themed subgenre; that ends up being as real as the effect of its subject. [Full review in Spanish].
1102,20170092,The unwieldiness is part and parcel of the movie's ragged appeal. None of this was by design.
1103,20170092,Rodchenkov proves a surprisingly lovable personality --- wry; funny; and gregarious. But things get dark and dangerous when the Russian Olympic doping program is exposed and Rodchenkov fears that he might be in a position of knowing too much.
1104,20170092,Icarus may be the best nonfiction movie of the year.
1105,20170093,Powerful; edgy docu about teen girls growing up in NYC.
1106,20170093,It's a documentary that should make audiences smile. Although the teenage subjects might be over it; there is a need for All This Panic.
1107,20170093,On top of being entertaining; illuminating; and affecting; the film is beautifully shot -- with gorgeous; hazy light and painterly framing -- it looks like a narrative feature.
1108,20170093,Director Jenny Gage; obviously cares about what teenage girls think and feel - and she wants viewers to; as well.
1109,20170093,Captures an innocence; normalcy; and authenticity that this age group rarely earns from documentary.
1110,20170093,The nostalgia for youth is a powerful lure; but All This Panic's greatest appeal is in the entertaining; empathetic and warm way these personal sagas are told.
1111,20170093,There's no judgment to be found here; only an unvarnished look at its subjects struggling to figure out who they are; what they want; and how they might achieve their goals.
1112,20170093,A composite portrait of girlhood; refracted - not especially rich in groundbreaking insight; but often shimmering with feeling.
1113,20170093,Gage makes each minute boldly and deeply matter.
1114,20170093,Adopting a meandering; free-flowing structure and woozily intimate photography; the director; Jenny Gage; and her husband; the cinematographer Tom Betterton; follow close and listen well.
1115,20170093,[Filmmakers Jenny Gage and Tom Betterton] got close to them as Brooklyn neighbors and spent three years following them as they matured and began to separate from parents and forge their own identities.
1116,20170093,The result is a pensive; gorgeous meditation on what it means to grow up.
1117,20170094,Maudie is an inspiring; heart-warming true-story film that most audiences will find hard to resist.
1118,20170094,Every now and then you come across a performance so extraordinary that it transcends its film and becomes a force of nature all its own. Sally Hawkins' towering work in Aisling Walsh's Maudie is one such performance.
1119,20170094,"Sally Hawkins received a Best Actress Oscar nomination for ""The Shape of Water""; but she was better in ""Maudie""."
1120,20170094,Hawkins and Hawke; both award-winning actors; turn in great performances; but is is Hawkins as Maude who will be hard to overlook at Oscar season this year.
1121,20170094,Oscillating between moments of pain and ones of inspiring artistic expression; Maudie captures the nuance of Maud Lewis's life and her unexpected success as an artist.
1122,20170094,Maudie is a remarkable and utterly unique film that I still can't believe someone actually made; but much like Maud's paintings; someone saw a quality in her story that they recognized as worthy of attention; admiration; and beauty.
1123,20170094,A big performance at the centre of rather a modest film.
1124,20170094,Maud Lewis left the world a brighter place than she found it. This drably earnest rendering of her life story doesn't follow suit.
1125,20170094,A difficult and highly mannered performance from Sally Hawkins coupled with a repugnant and profoundly unappealing character played by Ethan Hawke sink this curious; and curiously saccharine; biopic.
1126,20170094,Maud's life was constricted; but her gaze was expansive. And so is her movie.
1127,20170094,Both writer and director set out in search of a heroine. They're so intent on crafting a legend; they leave out the uncomfortable bits. They do her and us a disservice in that respect.
1128,20170094,Maudie ... is a film to fall in love with.
1129,20170095,The storytelling is simple but effective; with Zandvliet's script doing a nice job of establishing these young boys and showing the relationship that built between them and the sergeant.
1130,20170095,This effortless picture is anchored by a barnstorming Roland Møller; he and his director juggle motives and expectations to alarming effect.
1131,20170095,Concise; poignant; and captivating; Land of Mine offers a novel yet intuitive glimpse of a war we see quite often on film.
1132,20170095,A beautiful study on the contradictory nature of resentment and the importance of forgiveness. [Full Review in Spanish]
1133,20170095,As a character study set during unique yet harrowing times; Land of Mine continues in the vein of difficult yet important cinematic subject matter; reflecting the cruel effects war has on human behavior; no matter the side.
1134,20170095,A positively terrifying post-World War II suspense work... You'll spend most of Land of Mine on the edge of your seat.
1135,20170095,It's a harrowing story neatly shaped into melodrama by Danish writer-director Martin Zandvliet.
1136,20170095,Most of the film's power and interest comes from the ethical discussion it inspires.
1137,20170095,A poignant and worthy tribute to a little-known postscript of World War Two.
1138,20170095,A tough; well-made war movie - sometimes shockingly violent - about a little known and very grim moment at the end of the second world war.
1139,20170095,Denmark's so-called biggest war crime forms the historical backdrop of this nerve-jangling bomb-disposal drama
1140,20170095,Land of Mine is small but powerfully formed.
1141,20170096,The dour comedic tone and discarded protagonists feel very familiar; and the film comes off as a forgettable chapter in a long book.
1142,20170096,Despite its heavy subject matter; The Other Side of Hope is a gently comic tale of disparate souls united by a common humanity.
1143,20170096,Syrian refugee Kahled turns himself into police and seeks asylum after covertly boarding a cargo ship and ending up in Finland.
1144,20170096,With a very contrasted photography with the use of hard lights; the director delves us into a story without good or bad... transferring a very particular atmosphere to the film. [Full Review in Spanish]
1145,20170096,The filmmaker asks his audience to not only laugh (as he always does) but to contemplate; to put themselves in the shoes of a person they will likely never be or know.
1146,20170096,Can be likened to the bleak but worthy resume of Jim Jarmusch.
1147,20170096,The guiding ethic of The Other Side of Hope is as much topical as it universal: that altruism is not especially brave or courageous; but just the basic principle governing relations between human beings.
1148,20170096,One couldn't help but think of the obvious; heavy-handed messaging we'd be spared if all directors followed Kaurismki's expert smuggling techniques.
1149,20170096,It's refreshing to see a film about the refugee crisis that doesn't rely on cliche; but the fact remains: The mundane is mundane.
1150,20170096,Blues musicians in Finland. Who know there was such a thing?
1151,20170096,"Finnish films have been generating buzz lately. ""Tom of Finland"" and ""The Happiest Day in the Life of Olli Maki"" have found a small; if enthusiastic; audience...Aki Kaurismki's charmingly deadpan ""The Other Side of Hope"" should follow a similar path."
1152,20170096,Most of the characters face a daily question: to be kind or unkind. Kaurismaki builds a heroic narrative around that idea.
1153,20170097,Goofy; uneven; alternately outrageous and charming (when not both at once); Endless Poetry is as good an introduction to his work as any; and it couldn't have been made by anyone else.
1154,20170097,Endless Poetry is constantly engaged in the act of invoking without ever evoking anything. In that sense; its name is just wrong; there's no poetry to it at all.
1155,20170097,Functions as an attempt at personal reconciliation with past experiences that can never be truly recreated... The director's latest shows the beginnings of a visionary growing fed up with structure and boundaries.
1156,20170097,Alejandro Jodorowsky has created a surrealist autobiography that will certainly enrapture the fans of the filmmaker.
1157,20170097,The sheer artistry in just one frame of Endless Poetry is enough to send you into sensory overload.
1158,20170097,The mix of vulgarity and spirituality; of affectionate freakshow and savage political theater; is pure Jodorowsky; and you can feel his restless invention swirling through every scene.
1159,20170097,Endless Poetry feels like the product of a revitalized old master. There's a generosity of spirit; and clarity of intent that gives shape to the the film's rambling narrative; and broad-brushstrokes characterizations.
1160,20170097,The filmmaker's outsize; and sometimes unnerving; stylistic choices jump into the frame and vanish just as quickly.
1161,20170097,Loopy; irreverent; and more intensely personal than anything its mystic creator has invented before.
1162,20170097,"Tinged with madness and heartbreak; ""Endless Poetry"" is the unmistakable byproduct of; as the character of Alejandro puts it; ""a heart capable of loving the entire world."""
1163,20170097,if you consider Jodorowsky's work excessive and mannered; you'll probably find this to be a slog.
1164,20170097,By the time Alejandro confronts his father...it occurs that self-indulgence is sort of the point and that it just might be in the service of something that is actually; simply profound. Jodorowsky is dramatizing his life; just like everybody else does.
1165,20170098,A theologically complex; yet exquisitely beautiful and spiritual journey; one's patience is rewarded with a richness and soul searching introspective experience that lingers long after the curtain falls on Silence.
1166,20170098,Silence is an experience that makes us question our own resolve and tremble at its power.
1167,20170098,You might even find yourself wondering whether you need to find more spirituality; more faith; more meaning in your life - even if it's not in the form of Christianity.
1168,20170098,Scorsese has been trying to get this film through development since 1990. In the ensuing decades; he seems to have identified a little too strongly with his protagonists. Silence doesn't so much question suffering as wallow around in it.
1169,20170098,This is complex and challenging filmmaking that's designed to unsettle and asks questions that lack easy answers.
1170,20170098,It is a film that is worthy of -- and will likely inspire -- a great deal of discussion; contemplation; debate; and yes; even criticism. And it may be the movie I most enjoyed talking about with others in 2016.
1171,20170098,This may not be Scorsese's best film; but it's unquestionably his most impassioned.
1172,20170098,For those not exulted by the inner-workings of devotion; it's a slog.
1173,20170098,Alternately powerful and somnolent.
1174,20170098,Scorsese doesn't glorify martyrdom; and he doesn't even hate the killers. He makes death as blunt and dull and useless as a snapped pencil. The point is that there is no point.
1175,20170098,While the craftsmanship is undeniable and the themes of spiritual belief; betrayal and redemption are laudable; the film feels flat and not as emotional or moving as it should be.
1176,20170098,Even at its unnecessary length; Silence is seldom boring.
1177,20170099,Far from being depressing; dirge-like or morbid; Obit is vivacious; funny and effortlessly entertaining.
1178,20170099,It's almost enough to inspire the reader to go out and do something important
1179,20170099,A newsroom doc that manages a lovely exploration of the true craft of writing; and a film that all journalism junkies should seek out.
1180,20170099,It's always the films about death which end up being the most life-affirming; isn't it?
1181,20170099,Nothing to do with death; everything to do with life.'
1182,20170099,In the end; you wonder if your life's accomplishments would get you such an expertly written obituary. If so; you certainly hope it's written by people who care as much about their work as these folks.
1183,20170099,The people brought to life here; using a combination of the written obituary and news clips; are a varied and fascinating bunch.
1184,20170099,These folks are neither dour nor sappy; they are just talented journalists who want to do right by the people who left their mark on the world.
1185,20170099,"It is fascinating to watch the writers in ""Obit"" strive to do right by their subjects; warts and all."
1186,20170099,As someone who takes great pleasure in both reading and writing valedictions to the recently deceased; I can personally attest that the movie's dead on.
1187,20170099,"The real subject here is storytelling; the creation of a stylish; authoritative; highly personal record of ""how the world got to be the way it is."" One more thing to miss about newspapers when they go."
1188,20170099,"""Obit"" manages to be both about a specific type of journalism and the larger world it reflects while dropping in all manner of colorful lives and circumstances."
1189,20170100,...a slow-moving narrative that grows more and more absorbing as the admittedly familiar storyline unfolds...
1190,20170100,Brawl in Cell Block 99 is a bone breaking; face stomping; skull crushing experience that is viciously torturous to endure at times; but is lustfully satisfying when you've had a rough day.
1191,20170100,Vaughn comes off looking like Boris Karloff's Frankenstein's Monster channeling the spirit of Jason Statham.
1192,20170100,...the kind of vicious; no-nonsense prison drama that dads dream about when the TV is finally theirs to command.
1193,20170100,Writer-director S. Craig Zahler takes his handiwork so seriously that viewers may do the same.
1194,20170100,"Vince Vaughn is so intimidating in ""Brawl in Cell Block 99;"" even the back of his head seems to be glaring at us and asking; ""Do we have a problem here?"""
1195,20170100,In terms of its storyline alone; this is a bit of a potboiler; a typical prison drama; but the dialogue is razor sharp and the performances; especially that of Vince Vaughn; are far more nuanced and poignant than you'd expect.
1196,20170100,Vaughn's performance is hard; dark; and mercilessly committed; and the film gives you nowhere to hide from it - no twangs of irony or conspiratorial winks to take the edge off what ensues.
1197,20170100,Vaughn's unrelentingly great performance anchors a movie that will engage you for every minute of its runtime. Surprisingly very; very good.
1198,20170100,I celebrate the catharsis of Cell Block 99 for dramatizing the personal virtues imperiled by venal officials and partisan social arbiters as well as by fate.
1199,20170100,Undoubtedly; Brawl will be too much for many; if not most; viewers; and even if the violence doesn't put you off; the surrealness of it just might. Roll with it; though; and it's a brilliant; skull-shaking thriller unlike anything else you'll see.
1200,20170100,I can't remember violence in a film eliciting such verbal reactions.
1201,20180001,It is epic in so many ways and important for all of us to experience; start discussions about; and champion.
1202,20180001,Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger is easily one of Marvel's best antagonists.
1203,20180001,It had a lot of heart and it was really fun.
1204,20180001,They really took care with the story.
1205,20180001,Boseman has such charisma; charm; depth and grace; it's as easy to believe him as a king as it is to see him do insane acrobatics as a superhero.
1206,20180001,Black Panther may be long over due; but there was nothing about this film that didn't feel less than exactly what it should have or could have been.
1207,20180001,If it isn't indisputably the best of Marvel's 18 offerings; it is certainly a contender.
1208,20180001,The identity politics provide a fresh spin to the genre's increasingly tedious narrative formula.
1209,20180001,Whether or not this is the best film Marvel Studios has made to date-and it is clearly in the discussion-it is by far the most thought-provoking.
1210,20180001,"When it comes to creative visuals; engaging action and likable characters; ""Black Panther"" stands confidently next to the best fare offered up by the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
1211,20180001,"""Black Panther"" lived up to the hype."
1212,20180001,Each man and woman...is resplendent in Ruth Carter's traditional costumes. Indigenous dialects are spoken amid the space flights; museum heists; and car chases.
1213,20180002,The film knows how to make your pulse race; but the story is the same as any other Mission: Impossible film and the sequel is basically dead as far as any sort of emotional acting goes. Impressive action doesn't make up for a defused storyline.
1214,20180002,In a summer that has seen too many sequels already; this one stands out from the crowd as its crown jewel.
1215,20180002,It could have been chopped down by 20-minutes; but even then; it never loses its audience - and that's what you must shoot for when telling a story.
1216,20180002,Combined with exciting sequences such as adrenaline-fuelled motorcycle chases to one of the best bathroom fights in recent cinema; Fallout is easily one of the most thrilling action films this year.
1217,20180002,Tom Cruise runs on screen for ten straight minutes which means high-level action enjoyment!
1218,20180002,Every action sequence in this movie is thrillingly staged with visceral perfection.
1219,20180002,"The problem with constructing a movie as one long making-of sequence is that; if it's a movie as inert as this one; it doesn't so much answer the question ""How was it made?"" as pose another one altogether: Why?"
1220,20180002,Cruise will never win an Oscar for playing Hunt; but what he does in Mission: Impossible - Fallout is surely at least as taxing as; say; Leonardo DiCaprio's role in The Revenant; with the added obligation of making it look like fun.
1221,20180002,With the Resident Evil saga apparently complete and no further Mad Max adventures on the immediate horizon; Mission: Impossible must qualify as the best Hollywood action series now going.
1222,20180002,Mission: Impossible - Fallout is an unrelentingly consistent action movie; with not a single sequence wasted before the next big stunt.
1223,20180002,The thought crosses the mind: Where can it go from here? The answer is pretty much everywhere. It keeps on going and going; following one exciting sequence with another and then another.
1224,20180002,Ironically; the most entertaining element of all may be the star's advancing age; Cruise; well into his 50s; scores numerous laughs as the increasingly confused CIA agent; leaping into one spectacular stunt after another and then wishing he hadn't.
1225,20180003,Spike Lee directs one of the most powerful films to date on racial discrimination.
1226,20180003,BlacKkKlansman is a buoyant buddy-cop caper; a loving homage to Blaxploitation films; and an intelligent conversation with the past and the present.
1227,20180003,It's a joy to see someone with Lee's command of his craft let loose on a film. Like a jazz musician; he stages and edits the majority of scenes in Blackkklansman with electrifying spontaneity and flow.
1228,20180003,America should be well past the events told in this film; but because we aren't; this film is here to remind us. It's all the more incredible for being so entertaining while doing so.
1229,20180003,Spike Lee has achieved a new career high with this film that shines despite small narrative failures because of its strong and incredibly relevant message; solid performances; great editing and good cinematography.
1230,20180003,In BlacKkKlansman; [Spike] Lee is back to what he does best; as he and his talented cast deliver one of the most evocative films of the year.
1231,20180003,Spike Lee is back and it's good to see him ride this new wave of black cinema; especially since he was responsible for the last one.
1232,20180003,There's the sense that Lee is seeing our present reality not as a reason to give up hope but to remind Americans of the stakes; to rally them to take back their country from those who would make it 1953 again.
1233,20180003,In Washington and Driver; Lee finds two actors who understand his methods and deliver exceptional performances.
1234,20180003,BlacKkKlansman is one of those magical movies where the filmmaker takes aim at what a less ambitious storyteller would say is too many targets; hitting each and every one of them with the precision of a career assassin.
1235,20180003,Due in no small part to the daily horrors of the Trump presidency; Lee seems to have recaptured that spark that gave us the kind of scathingly frank commentary coupled with an intimate African American perspective invocative of Do the Right Thing
1236,20180003,John David Washington is... an up-and-coming talent worth keeping an eye on.
1237,20180004,Spider-Verse looks more like a gorgeous comic than a reproduction of a live action film.
1238,20180004,It's a literal and symbolic passing of the torch; easily the best Spider-Man film since Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2; and one of the best animated and superhero films of all time.
1239,20180004,Combined with the fast-paced action sequences and an energetic soundtrack; the film is a heady cocktail of entertainment.
1240,20180004,Impossible shots coupled with a breezy screenplay make this the most fun superhero movie since Sam Raimi shot an upside down Toby Maguire kissing Kirsten Dunst.
1241,20180004,There's a perfect balance between humor and pathos; a regular stream of jokes occasionally intersected with moments of real heart.
1242,20180004,A punk version of a story of which we've seen adaptations before. But never something as bold as this. [Full review in Spanish].
1243,20180004,Yet with great power comes great responsibility. And one such responsibility; as a critic; is to admit when you've made a mistake.
1244,20180004,The spectacularly colorful; varied; and busy animation is impressive but bombastic; leaving little room for wonder and suggesting exertion rather than inspiration.
1245,20180004,The latest entry in a fully saturated genre that somehow; through sheer creative gumption; does something new.
1246,20180004,"""This film manages the delicate feat of embracing its source material while also satirizing it."""
1247,20180004,A great story from top to bottom.
1248,20180004,Actually captures the sensation of getting absorbed in a comic book.
1249,20180005,A fantastic first film from a great actor turned director with a stellar performance by a Queen of Pop who might become a star in a totally different medium.
1250,20180005,This is high melodrama of a kind rarely seen these days; or executed this well at any time.
1251,20180005,More like A Star Is Bored. Am I right? No? I'm the only one who isn't gaga for Gaga? Fine; then.
1252,20180005,It's a solid movie. It's really good. I thought Lady Gaga is fantastic.
1253,20180005,It's a really good movie. I was impressed.
1254,20180005,Star is Born is a tour de force directorial debut that channels Cooper's off-screen struggles with addiction and sobriety that vibes deeply personal and painfully honest.
1255,20180005,While imperfect; A Star Is Born is a satisfying and emotionally evocative epic. If only it had managed to maintain the intoxicating allure of its first hour.
1256,20180005,Lady Gaga has created a delicate; likeable character who serves as the film's emotional barometer in that as her feelings change; so too will those of the audience.
1257,20180005,Bradley Cooper's modern reworking is passable enough to keep you entertained.
1258,20180005,With the power of its music and its two leads (plus some nice support); A Star Is Born is a worthy retread of a well-worn path.
1259,20180005,Transposed into the era of sudden fame and instant shame; the film glistens as a cautionary tale about self-respect; self-delusion and self-destruction...what is especially admirable is the film's fidelity to the original's heart-breaking final reel.
1260,20180005,Pop singer Lady Gaga is quite good as the wife... she subtly and convincingly manages the character's transformation from vulnerable ingenue to self-confident celebrity.
1261,20180006,Eighth Grade may legitimately be the last movie in this genre to ever stun me and move me like it did.
1262,20180006,"""Be yourself and don't care about whatever people think of you;"" 13-year-old Kayla sweetly advises on her YouTube channel. But Kayla is a little girl lost."
1263,20180006,It lures the audience in with the promise of nostalgia and present-day security; then challenges it to take a long look at itself in the mirror.
1264,20180006,Though the cast is young; being made up of mostly teenagers; they are well versed and trained and Burnham elicits terrific performances from then all.
1265,20180006,Burnham's biggest gift here as a storyteller is his compassion and refusal to pretend the differences between today's kids and the rest of us is anything other than trivial.
1266,20180006,It's hard to be middle school age where you are betwixt and between. [Bo Burnham] Burnham successfully displays the challenge it presents for kids and for parents. And he does it with a lot of humor and empathy.
1267,20180006,The film shows the disturbing disconnect between online confidence and in-person self-consciousness.
1268,20180006,Eighth Grade reminds us that teenage girls and Kayla's story are valid; and we should all listen a little more closely.
1269,20180006,Such honesty in presenting a teenage girl makes writer/director Bo Burnham's movie a superior coming-of-age story.
1270,20180006,Like a lot of teenagers; EIGHTH GRADE is funny; awkward; and ambitious - it is a film that represents an accomplished graduation for both Bo Burnham and Elsie Fisher.
1271,20180006,This is a kind; loving film that will warm your heart to no end.
1272,20180006,A coming of age. A slice of life. The rites of passage. Though any of these tags could be applied here; none of them completely fit. For this exquisitely poignant portrait of a solitary teenage girl is quite unlike anything we have seen before.
1273,20180007,The surround system is equally sublime; simulating action not seen on the screen; giving the film a transportive; immersive feel.
1274,20180007,By paying homage to his childhood; [Cuarón] has created a simple yet jaw-droppingly beautiful film that can only be seen as one thing: a visual masterpiece.
1275,20180007,Alfonso Cuarón's most masterful film contains multitudes.
1276,20180007,Fundamentally; it's a character piece about Chloe. Aparicio's placid; yet expressive face sometimes recalls Renée Falconetti in The Passion of Joan of Arc. Hers is a brilliant; unmannered performance.
1277,20180007,Roma is intimate; epic and female-focused; not unlike filmmaker Alfonso Cuaron's 2013 intergalactic 3-D odyssey Gravity... But Roma is also an immersive nostalgic valentine to his '70s childhood in Mexico City.
1278,20180007,The movie's distance here works against it; emphasizing its outsider's view of what it frames as lower-class concerns. Instead of lending her character dimensionality; Cleo's tribulations begin to feel cartoonishly grim.
1279,20180007,"Alfonso Cuaron's new film; ""Roma;"" gives you so much to see in each new vignette; in every individual composition; in fact; that a second viewing becomes a pleasurable necessity rather than a filmgoing luxury."
1280,20180007,"Roma captures; as well as any film I have seen; the spirit of ""magical realism;"" without ever hinting at the supernatural. Its magic is pure; stunning cinematic technique."
1281,20180007,"For all its worthy intentions; ""Roma"" is little more than the righteous affirmation of good intentions."
1282,20180007,This has plenty to say about class relations too; but what's most impressive about it is how the Mexican writer-director-cinematographer-editor transforms even his political observations into the stuff of big-screen spectacle.
1283,20180007,It's beautiful story; he shot it himself along side writing and directing; at this stage we can see it in a bunch of different places; its on Netflix & in theaters; but go see it in theaters!
1284,20180007,In Cuarón's films; cinema conjures up its own world; and this one provides the chance to explore it with him more intimately than ever before.
1285,20180008,[A] quiet; dark; and chilling film to experience.
1286,20180008,A Quiet Place is likely to be the best horror film released in 2018; as it shows a great balance of humanity and horror.
1287,20180008,A polished slice of fear inducing genre fare. Creating horror by relying on craftsmanship is a risk when your career is still young; but it pays off in spades here.
1288,20180008,Tight editing builds the suspense in this excellent horror film.
1289,20180008,The concept for the movie is so basic you would think it was uninspired and couldn't possibly be any good but you would be wrong.
1290,20180008,A Quiet Place is a masterpiece.
1291,20180008,You'll root for the Abbotts till your cheeks are sodden. All hail a blockbuster that's ultra-sound. And pray that it blows the competition away.
1292,20180008,But there are moments when the movie takes us firmly by the hand and escorts us down a darkened path; and they lead to one of the most profound of communal pleasures: the sound of a movie audience screaming as one.
1293,20180008,This is a movie about the sound of fear; but it gives us a great deal more to listen to.
1294,20180008,At a brisk 90 minutes; it's one of the most inventive and beautifully crafted and acted horror movies I've seen in a very long time; and I think the main reason for its power is the family crisis at its core.
1295,20180008,John Krasinski the writer; director; and star; has really found an interesting way to get at the problems around how to handle not having sound in a film.
1296,20180008,A familiar premise is redeemed by a nifty gimmick in this suspenseful horror thriller.
1297,20180009,This film is a 'portrait of an artist' in its rawest form. It is an unflattering character study; yet also one of the most sympathetic too.
1298,20180009,Can You Ever Forgive Me? is one of those movies that's so good that you almost miss it the first time.
1299,20180009,More than enough evidence that McCarthy is the real deal as she closes off her usual buoyant avenues of emoting for a darker; morose and complex persona.
1300,20180009,The story may be mostly true; but the movie makes it believable. It contains no flashbacks; no explanations; just narrative drive and character exposition.
1301,20180009,An inoffensive story that serves as a platform for its performers; rather than creating a character study that will be worth remembering in years to come.
1302,20180009,McCarthy is magnificent at conveying Israel's sadness; her world-weariness; and the desperation that leads her to a life of crime.
1303,20180009,McCarthy is very good at showing how Lee's unpleasant bad temper and rudeness were not simply part of her psychological makeup: they were symptoms of existential panic.
1304,20180009,The screenplay by Nicole Holofcener and Jeff Whitty is well structured; witty and poignant. The funniest moments tend to be the most painful or humiliating ones.
1305,20180009,We can't believe the two got away with it for so long. But simultaneously we will them on.
1306,20180009,Every beat of the film is just so; its portraiture as rich as the characters themselves are barely solvent.
1307,20180009,The revelation of McCarthy's turn is that she's just allowed to be; without apology; without schmaltz.
1308,20180009,This film takes an altogether different view of the imitation game. By embracing frauds and failures; it achieves greatness on the sly.
1309,20180010,It's a genuine crowd pleaser that rewards viewing on the big screen; which is what a summer movie is all about.
1310,20180010,"While original; witty and super entertaining; this 14-year sequel also poses as a cautionary tale for future Pixar ""family films."" Disappointing in that regard"
1311,20180010,Incredibles 2 gets an easy pass on character strength alone.
1312,20180010,Incredibles 2 might be a cash grab for NYSE:DIS; but; thankfully; not the artists behind the project. Here's a rare sequel that matches the original by narrowing its focus.
1313,20180010,On a whole; it's still fun and cute.
1314,20180010,It's still a fun movie to watch.
1315,20180010,Incredibles 2 regresses to a time when any power women managed to acquire was carefully controlled so as not constitute a threat to the male order. Such nostalgia is self-defeating.
1316,20180010,How great to see them back in this funny; exciting; if less audacious film.
1317,20180010,The movie is funny; exuberant; inventive. It's even wise.
1318,20180010,A gorgeously curated scrapbook of sharply observed household comedy; sublimely staged action; a pinch of Chuck Jones-era slapstick; and enough modernist eye candy to induce a sugar coma in design buffs.
1319,20180010,The result is hugely entertaining and often visually audacious...yet it doesn't quite pack the emotional wallop of the original.
1320,20180010,Brad Bird not only directs with the same assured inventiveness he brought to The Incredibles (and Ratatouille; and The Iron Giant); but has written a script every bit as smart; witty and touching as the first.
1321,20180011,The movie contributes little to the urgent contemporary project of diversifying representation... Yet; for two hours and change; Call Me By Your Name is an overwhelmingly pleasant and seductive place to live.
1322,20180011,Call Me By Your Name is one of the most beautiful films I saw in 2017; but ultimately it left me unsettled.
1323,20180011,There wasn't nearly enough Italy porn or gay porn.
1324,20180011,I still enjoyed a lot of this movie.
1325,20180011,The director's use of location is almost too good to be true; and will likely make you want to book at trip to Italy immediately.
1326,20180011,A delicious boy-meets-boy romance.
1327,20180011,You may not realize how strong the acting is until you replay the movie in your head later.
1328,20180011,The film is beautifully shot and the performances are outstanding.
1329,20180011,"""Call Me By Your Name"" is a visually stunning coming-of-age story that boasts a star-making performance by Chalamet."
1330,20180011,It's a story less about the characters involved than it is about the dynamics between them; a late addition to the Symposium's accounts of the great god Love.
1331,20180011,This coming-of-age love story is all texture; tone and nuance...Luca Guadagnino has made a lovely cinematic feather. And it floats down beautifully; riding a soft breeze of melancholy and grace.
1332,20180011,A modern-day Visconti; Italian director Luca Guadagnino (I Am Love) grants us entry into a world not only of wealth but of culture; which can be just as liberating.
1333,20180012,Lusciously designed and featuring a trio of fiery female performances and some acidicly funny dialogue; it's a naughty crowdpleaser.
1334,20180012,It features a sharp; farcical screenplay (by Tony McNamara and Deborah Davies); along with Lanthimos' signature weirdness and Oscar-worthy performances by three strong women.
1335,20180012,For all the laughter The Favourite raises; it is also a tragedy; and like the very best comedies it offers some sympathy for the demise of people being used for our entertainment.
1336,20180012,It's a dark view; but dark views; like sunny views; have to come from somewhere. Where is Lanthimos's dark sun? I don't know; but I'll definitely keep watching.
1337,20180012,A sharp look into the intimacies of Monarchy and its perks. As funny and tragic as it should be. [Full review in Spanish].
1338,20180012,The film is much more saturated in the attitudes of the Catholic Church [...] and deals with this particularly 'Catholic' mix of issues that the story brings up.
1339,20180012,As well as being [Lanthimos'] biggest production so far; this is by far his most pleasurable; with three Oscar-worthy performances.
1340,20180012,The Favourite is so assaultively entertaining that you keep wanting to go outside for fresh air.
1341,20180012,Colman; always brilliant; has never seemed more divine. If she's not nominated for an Oscar; I will cry.
1342,20180012,Breaking: Olivia Colman is our new god.
1343,20180012,Weisz and Stone are both brilliantly witty and nimble; but Colman's performance is nothing short of sublime.
1344,20180012,Yorgos Lanthimos' dryly funny historical feature is all about power; and that means literally wearing the pants in a strange time.
1345,20180013,Everything from the sweet; precisely melodramatic performances to the King's mile-a-minute setups and payoffs works like a charm.
1346,20180013,Its expert craftsmanship is keenly directed toward warming you with its wit; its unfussy kindness. At the centre of it all is a bear who's the real deal. That he's a CGI creation is at once impressive and enough to make your heart hurt.
1347,20180013,Paul King made a thrilling; funny; heartwarming film with Paddington 2; one that easily outclasses its predecessor. [TOP 50 FILMS OF THE DECADE]
1348,20180013,The Paddington Cinematic Universe is original; inventive and fun; stacked with classic comedy references; packed with every British character actor going and finished with optimistic humanism.
1349,20180013,The comedy; acting; set design are all outstanding.
1350,20180013,The film will put a big grin on your face; even if you don't find it laugh-out-loud funny. As tedious as they can be; sometimes watching movies about good people helping each other makes a world of difference.
1351,20180013,[Paddington 2] has one out-loud laugh; plenty of sincere cleverness; vast technical ingenuity; a warm heart; lively performances and enough gyroscopic camera moves to make Max Ophüls jealous.
1352,20180013,"All in all; ""Paddington 2"" has a warmth and wit that's missing from many a children's movie. Don't let your January go by without it."
1353,20180013,Best of all is Hugh Grant as a villainous ham actor who gets to dress up in any number of ridiculous costumes before ending the film with a production number that only Mel Brooks has ever matched.
1354,20180013,A movie that promotes the importance of family and good manners might seem like it could become the squarest of snoozes; but Paddington 2 is so transcendentally cheerful that it carries the day - and then some.
1355,20180013,A dash of Wes Anderson and a sprinkle of Jean-Pierre Jeunet; swirled around with a wonderfully fluid sense of airiness and light. It's mannered; yet carefree; colorful; and evocative.
1356,20180013,The Paddington films preach a message of acceptance that's no less straightforward than that of The Shape of Water; encouraging viewers to share in the hero's tolerant worldview.
1357,20180014,A father and daughter story of haunting beauty.
1358,20180014,The simple story touches on themes of trauma and loss; belonging and technology. But it does so effortlessly by focusing on a relationship between a father and daughter.
1359,20180014,What I most appreciate about Granik's approach is how she eschews exposition and trusts her leads -- in this case; a terrific Ben Foster in a rare contemplative role; and knock-out New Zealand newcomer Thomasin Harcourt McKenzie.
1360,20180014,Leave No Trace will undoubtedly leave many impressions; as it is a beautiful and expertly made film that shouldn't be overlooked.
1361,20180014,Script; direction; and acting all work together to deliver a story that clearly communicates what is at stake for its characters and what they represent with a rare subtle intelligence.
1362,20180014,Granik has drawn yet another deeply affecting portrait of families who live on the margins - sometimes by choice; often because of circumstance. Her images of poverty are warmly generous; yet free of condescension or romanticisation.
1363,20180014,Leave No Trace is further evidence Granik is one of the most talented directors around - and Ben Foster ranks among the finest and most intense actors working today.
1364,20180014,Leave No Trace might be described in social terms as a film about homelessness; but it never loses sight of the fact that what makes a home is the privacy people need to connect with each other.
1365,20180014,The middle of a forest in Portland is the unlikely setting for this touching story from writer director Debra Granik as it explores the bond between father and daughter.
1366,20180014,Leave No Trace is a small film; but a quietly memorable one.
1367,20180014,As a coming of age tale it is sparse; bittersweet and desperately powerful - change is pulling these two interwoven lives apart; made explicit by Granik's empathy and unerring eye.
1368,20180014,Granik's star-making instincts are as sharp as ever.
1369,20180015,Widows is uncompromising; visceral and surprisingly thought-provoking.
1370,20180015,A heist movie elevated by layers of empathy and complexity.
1371,20180015,Podcast review
1372,20180015,McQueen's version of 'Widows' offer more than a straightforward heist film. There are dirty politics and family struggles being played out.
1373,20180015,Everything about Widows works. There's just no resisting it.
1374,20180015,While the sound and fury produced a robust response... the end result felt to me like a second-rate Elmore Leonard crime caper; a little too fanciful to be either top-drawer drama or stirring feminist tale.
1375,20180015,That essential jolt of satisfaction is missing.
1376,20180015,It offers everything adults used to love about cinema.
1377,20180015,It's the dashing camerawork and broad historical awareness of Widows that makes it a truly sophisticated action film; and by far the best crime movie of 2018 so far.
1378,20180015,A great ensemble cast; Steve McQueen lets loose on some of the formalism we've seen in some of his other films and; it moves really well.
1379,20180015,A thriller for modern women who identify more with the messiness of human lives than with flattened slogans about how great women; as a monolithic group; are.
1380,20180015,McQueen sets a relentlessly portentous tone and employs lots of stark mise-en-scene; but all the fuss feels arbitrary here - the pulpy story simply doesn't warrant such grave stylization.
1381,20180016,Documentaries are always judged first by their subject; and Neville has a knack for choosing exactly the right ones. A master of documentary structure; he makes the case for Rogers' continued relevance right out of the gate.
1382,20180016,Almost as if in these times of uncertainty and constant worry; we need a figure to trust in.
1383,20180016,It's a lovely inspirational little piece; eschewing schmaltzy sentimentality for genuine emotion.
1384,20180016,It's devastating and wonderful.
1385,20180016,Rogers didn't crash land here from a planet with a red sun; but he is a Superman.
1386,20180016,So settle in for a quiet and unassuming documentary about a nice man whose simple good intentions made a small but positive difference to the lives of millions of American children.
1387,20180016,A poignant tribute to the mild-mannered father-figure who served as moral compass to generations.
1388,20180016,It's daunting; particularly when we feel we are in the shadow of figures like him; who are seemingly capable of such impossible good.
1389,20180016,You don't need to have grown up with [Rogers] to be fascinated and moved by Morgan Neville's documentary portrait; made in a spirit of admiration; which on the evidence presented here seems well-deserved.
1390,20180016,Not beyond reproach; but a fitting tribute to a pop culture icon.
1391,20180016,This documentary by Morgan Neville reveals that he really was just what he seemed to be at first innocent sight: a kind-hearted; square but saintly man who genuinely loved and understood children in a pure; sincere way.
1392,20180016,This gentle; positive treatment of Rogers coincides with the show's values but devalues his enormous social importance.
1393,20180017,Filled with a compassionate; profound and intelligent narrative that never leaves you for a second; Shoplifters is the best film of the year and a perfect swan song to Kirin Kiki who literally gets buried in a Kore-eda household.
1394,20180017,It's accessible; fluently told and packs an unexpected punch.
1395,20180017,"""Shoplifters"" is a genuine Koreeda film; a masterful family drama; and of his best latest works; which definitely says something considering the quality of all of his films."
1396,20180017,With Shoplifters; Koreeda embarks on an ambitious philosophical journey to explore the fundamentals of family. [Full Review in Spanish]
1397,20180017,While this has the potential of becoming a bleak melodrama; Kore-eda ensures the story retains a sense of poignancy and emotionality.
1398,20180017,[SHOPLIFTERS] is top-notch Kore-eda with a Farhadi-esque moral dilemma and fantastic; nuanced filmmaking that never spoon-feeds the audience and presents its story in graceful; absorbing ways.
1399,20180017,There are numerous tender; affecting moments en route to the finale's tearjerker overdrive; many of them productively tangential to the overarching idea of choosing one's own family.
1400,20180017,At once charming and heart-wrenching; this exquisitely performed film will steal the hearts of both art-house and mainstream audiences.
1401,20180017,It's all beautifully done; if seemingly aimless; for most of its two-hour runtime; the joy of the movie lies mostly in watching these fine actors build their beautifully flawed and lived-in characters.
1402,20180017,Kore-eda is at his best when he's suppressing his sentimentality; not when he's indulging it; but like his characters; fans of this inspired filmmaker must learn to take the good with the bad.
1403,20180017,This kind of subtle richness is not new for Kore-Eda; though it's as satisfying here as it's ever been.
1404,20180017,A film that just grows and grows and grows. It seems very quiet; but you are absolutely hooked.
1405,20180018,After a heart wrenching and heavy Infinity War movie; we find a friend in the darkness. This sequel is the Marvel pause button - light at the end of the tunnel
1406,20180018,[D]irector Peyton Reed delivers an exciting and hilarious blockbuster that clips along a whiz-bang pace as it establishes that next great superhero partnership.
1407,20180018,Ant-Man and the Wasp is a welcome bit of formulaic fun; but it sits firmly in the middle to lower tier of the MCU.
1408,20180018,Ant-Man and the Wasp is hilarious; fun; silly; self aware; and creative.
1409,20180018,Like Ant-Man himself; wearing his heart on his sleeve; so earnest in wanting the best for those that he loves; Ant-Man and the Wasp just wants you to have a good time and leave a little happier than you came.
1410,20180018,The first coda is a beauty.
1411,20180018,The screenwriters (Rudd among them) frequently mock their own sci-fi jargon; their snarkiness the strong suit in a movie offering little else except souped-up car chases.
1412,20180018,This a film that's difficult to actively dislike - Rudd and his equally charming co-stars take care of that - and fun in the moment; but there's precious little that lingers after the credits roll.
1413,20180018,Its intent is limited to amusing and diverting for a couple of hours of high-summer fun. That it does.
1414,20180018,If the previous film was a bubbly champagne cocktail of a superhero movie; its sequel is something flatter and more concussive-akin to a series of vodka shots. Bottom line though; as long Paul Rudd is invited; it's still a party.
1415,20180018,This feels like the movie Oceans 8 should've been.
1416,20180018,"Director Peyton Reed and his army of screenwriters haven't made ""Ant-Man And The Wasp"" a terribly clever movie; but it's clever enough to keep you from reaching for bug spray. And in the summer; Marvel has apparently decided that's all that's required."
1417,20180019,It is a very funny comedy with an inspired cast that makes sure the political component will not dilute but neither monopolize the plot too much. [Full Review in Spanish]
1418,20180019,Armando Iannucci's new film is a scathing look at vile oppression; and a heap of fun as well.
1419,20180019,It may be cringe-worthy at times; what with its propensity for showing the Soviet world of violence; torture; and bloodletting; but for those who like their parables to be challenging and salty; do not miss this exceptional film.
1420,20180019,Everything about this movie works; particularly depicting the dictator's inner circle as a frat house. Hilarious and unsettling.
1421,20180019,A pretty good attempt at satirising the absurdities of end-game totalitarianism.
1422,20180019,The Death of Stalin strikes a tricky tone; but it rings true. The events portrayed in the film happened 65 years ago; and that distance gives us the ability to laugh at this very dark chapter in this country's history.
1423,20180019,Iannucci made the bravura decision to make a factual film of that event dressed in the black robe of English satire at its darkest. Surely; there was no other intelligent way to bring the story to an audience 75 years after the event.
1424,20180019,[Armando] Iannucci goes out of his way to really push the envelope to create some super memorable caricatures from living memory.
1425,20180019,In The Death of Stalin; you will find a political comedy so dark; the punchlines are all but blacked out. So be warned: while there is much to admire here; you may find little to be amused by.
1426,20180019,The Death of Stalin is signature Iannucci - absurd set-ups leading to even more outrageous ends via the spitefully delicious cadence of his dialogue.
1427,20180019,A devastatingly funny dissection of power politics; stripping the mystique from it and those who worship it. Iannucci has done it again.
1428,20180019,An incredibly funny film about a not-very-funny historical event.
1429,20180020,While the dissection of family values in Chinese culture goes beyond the stereotypes; Crazy Rich Asians is not a film willing to sacrifice a good time for depth. Go for the luxury; stay for the killer one-liners.
1430,20180020,A glitzy offering that asks for a redemption that perhaps will never be reconciled.
1431,20180020,[A] joyous; universally relatable film in the tradition of the best mainstream rom-coms.
1432,20180020,...the heart of the film is Yeoh; who is finally getting her due...Eleanor could have easily been dismissed as a stereotypical villain; but Yeoh gives her great nuance; and her backstory demands we have empathy for her.
1433,20180020,It was certainly a better movie than it was a book... This is exactly what I wanted.
1434,20180020,It lived up to my expectations.
1435,20180020,The whole film has an idiotic élan. It's a Jane Austen story done as razzmatazz romcom; plus a bit of all-singing; all-dancing Rebecca.
1436,20180020,Director Jon M. Chu keeps the plot racing along as Rachel is introduced to a small army of her boyfriend's relatives and friends.
1437,20180020,[A] good-natured and spectacular comedy...
1438,20180020,The director; Jon M Chu; thankfully; knows his rom-coms. There's Pretty Woman in here. There's Bridget Jones and Ever After; but he's made them new.
1439,20180020,In many ways; this supposed celebration of diversity disappoints. It doesn't matter. Its unpredictable female leads are as good as gold.
1440,20180020,Michelle Yeoh takes the acting honours as the heroine's steely prospective mother-in-law.
1441,20180021,More than simply highlighting prejudice; The Hate U Give peels back another layer and examines the issues that can divide the Black community from within.
1442,20180021,Amandla Stenberg is a force to be reckoned with as she finds her voice playing Starr with real and raw emotion.
1443,20180021,Two hours of unforgettable cinematic storytelling which kept me enthralled from the opening few frames until the closing credits.
1444,20180021,Ultimately; The Hate U Give is an incredibly powerful character study; a crackling thriller; and even a shrewd editorial on the impact of violence in America.
1445,20180021,The Hate U Give is poignant; significant and incredibly relevant.
1446,20180021,"They don't make ""issue movies"" better than this."
1447,20180021,The Hate U Give has a fierce storytelling grip.
1448,20180021,A bold and galvanic central turn and a ridiculously ambitious political agenda push this moving teenage melodrama far beyond the parameters of its own wonky sales pitch.
1449,20180021,Right here; right now; Starr Carter is a true screen rebel; entirely deserving of your respect and love.
1450,20180021,Worthwhile; but the dialogue lingers in the mind far more than the imagery does.
1451,20180021,The Hate U Give is about right now; and feels a perfect fit for it.
1452,20180021,It's a performance without any posturing -- no mean achievement in these circumstances.
1453,20180022,Phantom Thread is simply decadent. Delicious in every way.
1454,20180022,Doesn't really earn its push into psychodramatic territory at the midpoint.
1455,20180022,a film that when properly enthused; the viewer should find goes by quickly and gives sumptuous images for the eyes to feast on while the mind studies the flawed characters offered by the script and brought to life by a highly talented cast.
1456,20180022,An intense tale of passion and the boundaries which don't exist for some romantic relationships. [Full review in Spanish].
1457,20180022,In many ways; it's a perfect work of art -- not unlike Reynolds' dresses -- because it's not attempting to appeal to the masses. It's about the filmmaker putting onto the screen the exact vision he has in his mind.
1458,20180022,Phantom Thread is a triumphant valedictory send off for Daniel Day-Lewis; a tragicomic love letter to the agonies and ecstasies of the artist and those unlucky enough to fall in love with one.
1459,20180022,Take your seat; settle comfortably; prepare to be taken to hell and back; by a master tour guide using the scenic route.
1460,20180022,The pleasure here lies in the unpredictability of Paul Thomas Anderson's approach; his ability and that of his actors to surprise us with every new stitch of the movie.
1461,20180022,... I challenge you not to be grimly compelled by every minute of Phantom Thread.
1462,20180022,Possibly Paul Thomas Anderson's best film since that American auteur's staggeringly assured early work.
1463,20180022,As visual music grounded in a feeling of preposterous luxury; this is as enveloping and experimental as anything Anderson has done.
1464,20180022,Anderson has trouble coaxing this struggle to any sort of emotional climax; its fanciful; symbolic ending is the sort critics will praise for its careful ambiguity even as they overlook its narrative desperation.
1465,20180023,Combining science-fiction; comedy and politics amid the dull world of telemarketing; Sorry to Bother You is chaotic; creative and needs to be seen to be believed.
1466,20180023,You never stop rooting for Cassius; even when he's lured into making poor choices. And just when you think it can't get any weirder; it does.
1467,20180023,It's not an easy watch; but it is memorable and compelling -- the rare film that comments on the peculiar details of a historical moment while we are still going through it and makes all too clear sense of it.
1468,20180023,It's probably impossible to make a film that captures 2018's insane zeitgeist; but Boots Riley has come uncomfortably close.
1469,20180023,Sharp; vivid; often uncomfortable; but frequently hilarious; SORRY TO BOTHER YOU is a bold and distinctive vision that is rightly nowhere near as apologetic as the title.
1470,20180023,There's at least three different films smashed together here; and if taking things a little slower might have given some of the ideas room to breathe; it's this film's breathless energy that helps get the others over the line
1471,20180023,As mad and chaotic as the times we live in; it proves that laughter and hope go hand in hand.
1472,20180023,By the time the scream-gasp-and-giggle sci-fi climax arrives; we've lost interest in what happens to this hero or to this smug; undercranked movie.
1473,20180023,Stanfield has a heroic lightness and calm.
1474,20180023,Riley never once loses control. He sticks to the script. And the result is a triumph.
1475,20180023,While it's inevitably disappointing to watch this hot mess fly off the handle the way it does; the movie's ideas have an odd way of sticking even when the delivery method stalls.
1476,20180023,Sorry to Bother You is as much a character-driven story about the gentrification of Oakland -- and the Bay Area writ large -- as it is an absurdist anti-capitalist fable.
1477,20180024,While grand in scale; the characters are lost in the dark storyline.
1478,20180024,Even with the two hour and 40 minute running time; it still leaves you wanting more; which; of course; you'll have to wait a year for.
1479,20180024,The film seems to worship at the altar of tech and a form of awe at the literal manifestations of power.
1480,20180024,It did have a greater emotional range than a lot of other superhero movies. Because it had those actual consequences; it made it that much more exciting.
1481,20180024,They did a pretty good job.
1482,20180024,Infinity War makes good on a decade of character development and plot to deliver a crushing gut punch that will have fans reeling until the second; currently unnamed entry hits theaters in a year.
1483,20180024,Some of the sequences are undeniably thrilling but; at about 2-1/2 hours; overkill sets in early.
1484,20180024,This blockbuster leaves you wildly curious about the sequel; even if you are not an Avengers fanatic.
1485,20180024,"Never has the ""Marvel Cinematic Universe"" seemed like more of a universe; in ways both good and bad. Infinity War-the title is almost too apt-is far from a perfect movie; but it is probably close to the best movie it could have been."
1486,20180024,The insubstantiality of the film isn't due to the infinite yet flimsy malleability of C.G.I. gimmickry but; instead; to the dispersion of its drama throughout the many cinematic installations set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
1487,20180024,At stake; as ever; is the fate of the universe. Why must it always be the universe? What's wrong with the fate of Hackensack? Doesn't anyone care what happens to South Dakota; or Denmark; or Peru?
1488,20180024,With so many characters to cover; directors Anthony and Joe Russo have no time to develop any of them; and the action set pieces are all by the numbers.
1489,20180025,This is a kids movie that knows the kids can handle the darkness better than the grown ups.
1490,20180025,It's a beautifully crafted story about how much one boy will do for his dog and what one man will do for his ancestor's honour.
1491,20180025,Having the dogs speak English lets a presumed Western audience relate to them; but ironically; the movie in many ways turns the Japanese characters into an Other... In this sense; the film's form undermines its intent.
1492,20180025,Muttrise Kingdom? The Life Canine with Bryan Cranston? Although ISLE OF DOGS doesn't quite scale [Anderson's] recent heights; this engaging stop motion animation is full of humour and warmth that is surely difficult to hate.
1493,20180025,The real hero of Isle of Dogs is its design.
1494,20180025,I'm recommending the film because the lovely animation and the humor ultimately win out over everything; but this one may be tougher to revisit years from now.
1495,20180025,It remains more a dazzling conceit or experiment rather than a realized whole. We stay on the outside; admiring its originality and all the talent that went into it; without ever really finding our way in.
1496,20180025,Another utterly distinctive; formally brilliant exercise in savant innocence from Anderson; somewhere between arch naivety and inspired sophistication.
1497,20180025,A delight; albeit one that is red in tooth and claw.
1498,20180025,"Anderson's projects have always had a meticulous quality to them; but ""Isle of Dogs"" is exacting to the point of alienation. Someone needs a leash."
1499,20180025,This is outwardly one of Anderson's bleakest films. It's also one of his dullest and least emotional.
1500,20180025,The director and his hip writing partners (Jason Schwartzman; Roman Coppola; Kunichi Nomura) infuse their imaginary world with winning deadpan humor.
1501,20180026,I; Tonya understands these people; and does so with sympathy and pitch-black humor.
1502,20180026,The tone was fun; interesting; aggressive.
1503,20180026,Great performances.
1504,20180026,A nuanced; subversive; diamond-cutter of a film that may not always be reliable as we seek the truth; but it makes for a hell of a story however you slice it.
1505,20180026,Margot Robbie delivers a raw; disarmingly empathetic character study of the widely-despised Harding; who was born into poverty and rose to stardom only to be taken down by those who loved her.
1506,20180026,Director Craig Gillespie has reinvented the biopic; a notoriously dreary genre; by striking a hair-trigger balance between trauma and parody; mockumentary and melodrama; demolishing the fourth wall.
1507,20180026,What does emerge from every account is that Tonya Harding was a force of nature; single-minded; very tough and always ready to keep on fighting; even if she had the fatalistic view that people from her background simply weren't allowed to become winners.
1508,20180026,Compellingly stumped by its own heroine; the film simply can't make its mind up about Tonya Harding. If it did; it wouldn't get away with being such a blast.
1509,20180026,One of those rare films that gets better as it continues.
1510,20180026,A furiously engaging movie that features Margot Robbie in an ice rink; Margot Robbie at the action end of brutalising domestic abuse and; most significantly; Margot Robbie transforming fourth-wall breaking into a nearly sublime art form.
1511,20180026,It leaves a sense of several stronger movies half-buried beneath a mish-mash of the poignantly heart-rending and the outlandishly farcical; and just about salvaged from mediocrity by its one sensational turn.
1512,20180026,Gillespie has imbued his film with black humour; while never undermining the authenticity of the characters or detracting from the abuse that runs through the story.
1513,20180027,The Post should be a clarion call for the US media to do better; instead of an ode to its apparent infallible nobility. I found that the film was undone by its self-congratulatory message.
1514,20180027,Though there are a few too many shots of Streep entering rooms where she is the only woman; the film tries to underscore how unusual and thus lonely her position was.
1515,20180027,If you're a fan of good film craft -- as all right-thinking people should be -- you will flip for The Post. Spielberg may be the best steward of old-school film grammar we have left; and all of the classic virtues are on display.
1516,20180027,...it's a handsome film that has an economy of storytelling that most other filmmakers simply can't match. Yet it takes a good 45 minutes to build up a real sense of momentum; and we never feel the sense of existential terror...
1517,20180027,Steven Spielberg's didactic and mainstream sensibilities restrict The Post from being anything other than a slightly shallow reconstruction of its incendiary journalism story.
1518,20180027,It's the best work Streep has done in quite a while; and the movie doesn't succeed with such authority without her.
1519,20180027,A film about rushing to meet a deadline that feels like it was made that way.
1520,20180027,Enjoyable as it is; The Post may not meet the measure of success that Spielberg probably wants...
1521,20180027,... turns some sobering and timely questions about press power and presidential abuses into eminently satisfying screen entertainment.
1522,20180027,This is Streep's movie; and not because she is typically excellent. She owns it because Graham is the only character on a journey of self-discovery.
1523,20180027,The Post was exciting because everyone onscreen and in the audience embraced the premise that the Post had news to tell that would turn the world on its ear. Sometimes at home watching TV I'm not sure what news is any longer.
1524,20180027,[Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks'] best scenes together reveal how each journalist was compromised by cozy relationships with powerful Democrats (in his case; President Kennedy; in hers; defense secretary Robert McNamara).
1525,20180028,This may be [Damien] Chazelle's best film yet. It may not be a joyous celebration; but watching the intense performances and the meticulous detail; should put your over the moon.
1526,20180028,"""First Man"" soars as much when it's staying grounded as it does when Armstrong and the dreams of the nation finally reach that far-off star."
1527,20180028,Chazelle demonstrates the rare skill of staging epic spectacles within a most intimate setting.
1528,20180028,The up-close; frantic camera shots are replaced by glorious wide shots of the Saturn V rocket lifting off and leaving the Earth's atmosphere; accented by Justin Hurwitz's beautiful score.
1529,20180028,There are flashes of brilliance in First Man; but like the stuck thruster that almost killed Neil Armstrong before he ever got to the moon; the shoddy photography sends the whole thing spinning out of control.
1530,20180028,[Chazelle] offers a fresh perspective on Neil Armstrong's life at work; detailing his journey as an astronaut on a mission mostly shot either from an intimate or first-person point-of-view.
1531,20180028,It's a movie where the technique matches the ambition; one that moves from tragedy to grandeur to personal drama without becoming bombastic or even worse; falsely patriotic.
1532,20180028,As long as First Man is airborne; it's a marvel. I can't recall another movie that conveyed with such punch the perils and exhilarations of spaceflight. It's when the film is earthbound that it falls down.
1533,20180028,A long; draining; almost painful film that commands admiration more than love.
1534,20180028,This is a movie that - flag or no flag - doesn't need to take a political stance to make a political statement. ●
1535,20180028,A fascinating film; it's difficult to watch at times because there's so much loss and so much risk that we never really thought about that lead us getting there.
1536,20180028,Damien Chazelle is an enthusiastic; visually expressive filmmaker with practically nothing of interest to say about the human experience.
1537,20180029,There have been great screamers before; but Collette takes it to the next level with a guttural howl from the depths of her putrefying soul.
1538,20180029,It's creepy as anything you're apt to see in recent memory and will haunt you long after you see it.
1539,20180029,[A] film so deeply unsettling; so horrifying on an almost cellular level.
1540,20180029,I found it interesting enough.
1541,20180029,This was so stupid to me... Absolute; utter nonsense.
1542,20180029,Hereditary is a super effective slow burn shocker; a perfect blend of art house sensibilities and transgressive surreal horror that coalesces into a modern classic of the genre.
1543,20180029,Hereditary may not be as terrifying as the advance hype has suggested but it's a provocative and subtle horror film with layers you don't find in more conventional haunted house tales.
1544,20180029,Being blindsided by fright might be fun in the moment; but it's the scares you can see coming that last.
1545,20180029,It's an astonishing performance from Collette; a disorientating cocktail of humane; hurtful and hysterical.
1546,20180029,The results are horrific; emotionally and aesthetically; and launch a corkscrew spin towards hell.
1547,20180029,Toni Collette is flawless.
1548,20180029,Hereditary feels like an endless drawing out of that queasy; shocking; falling dream sensation; as the ground beneath the Graham family; and the viewer; crumbles.
1549,20180030,A good film filled with nuggets of Redford's career. [Full Review in Spanish]
1550,20180030,Redford has; paraphrasing Billy Wilder; a very small piece of cake; but it is undoubtedly his and no one else's.
1551,20180030,The comforting aesthetics of the film subverts the sharpness of the script; beguiling us with gentle warmth that momentarily hides the dark underbelly of the lives these men lead.
1552,20180030,An intriguing premise matched with relaxing music to compliment Robert Redford's calm disposition. The movie lacks a thrilling or surprising climax and conclusion.
1553,20180030,David Lowery celebrates his protagonist in an elegant and serene way. [Full Review in Spanish]
1554,20180030,Bank robber Forrest Tucker; a courtly senior cit with a quick; disarming smile; blazes a light-fingered trail through Texas in 1981.
1555,20180030,Redford picked a strong project to be his swan song and Lowery made sure he rode off into the sunset with dignity and flair.
1556,20180030,A positively rapturous send-off for star Robert Redford's storied career.
1557,20180030,The film is lighthearted and fun; more poetic than pulpy. It's a cops-and-robbers story ... in which the cop and robber have mutual affection.
1558,20180030,This touching; funny; romantic bank heist trip back to the late 70's is constructed with precision.
1559,20180030,A throwback caper film filled with great performances from legends and new greats.
1560,20180030,Lowery; who had the unenviable task of directing someone who has both a Best Director and Best Picture Oscar; is at the top of his game.
1561,20180031,Liu's emotional and powerful cine-memoir depicts a devastating portrait of how toxic masculinity can manifest in destructive ways.
1562,20180031,"Poignancy derived from the passage of time plays a similar; if less stark; role in Minding the Gap as it does in ""The Up Series"" and some of Richard Linklater's work."
1563,20180031,[Bing] Liu is one very sensitive and talented filmmaker who learned from the ground up. In addition; he happens to be a helluva skateboarder.
1564,20180031,While it's a film about skateboarding; it's also definitely not a film about skateboarding.
1565,20180031,A kaleidoscope of themes that; althoughat times is ambitious; is a beautiful draw. [Full review in Spanish]
1566,20180031,Heart-breaking glimpses of... lives in a film that uses a passion for skateboarding to expose the connections between poverty; race; sex and class in Trump's America.
1567,20180031,Each boy is likeable; troubled; searching; and hypnotically watchable in the way he puts his features on record; dimly conscious that his feelings are playing those features like a needle on a disc.
1568,20180031,It's as if all its director Bing Liu had to do was put the idea for his film at the top of a steep hill; give it a prod; then keep filming as natural forces took care of the rest.
1569,20180031,It is impossibly gripping; terribly personal; but always compassionate.
1570,20180031,This is a movie about what people are prepared to swallow when they're thirsty for love.
1571,20180031,It will warm your heart but possibly break it a little too.
1572,20180031,Though it runs just 93 minutes; this cinema-verite documentary by Bing Liu manages to feel like an epic.
1573,20180032,A delicate and tremulous thing; at once confident and gentle; lyrically composed yet as stoic as the American masculine ideal it so carefully deconstructs.
1574,20180032,Bold; heartfelt and; most importantly; unafraid; this is a remarkable film.
1575,20180032,A projection of the most organic feelings that ends up as a direct path to the heart of the public. [Full Review in Spanish]
1576,20180032,Chloé Zhao's The Rider serves as a testament for why making the extra effort to tell underrepresented stories matters.
1577,20180032,It reminds us of the dignifying power of work and purpose in human existence; even as it ponders the meaning of life when these things are taken away.
1578,20180032,The sort of deep; meaningful film that reminds us why we are so lucky the independent film industry exists in the first place.
1579,20180032,Brady; rarely raising his voice above a murmur; takes us on an emotional journey; figuring out his own way forward. The plains go on forever; so; we hope; does hope.
1580,20180032,Not fiction; not documentary. Instead; a story standing under a chimerical moon while fate; laconic and inarticulate like its victims; growls from far off.
1581,20180032,What is most startling here is the sensitivity with which [director Chloé] Zhao tackles such a downbeat tale.
1582,20180032,A remarkable film in many respects; and Zhao works wonders with a non-professional cast.
1583,20180032,Jandreau proves a charismatic draw; even if some of the supporting non-actors struggle with naturalistic performances.
1584,20180032,An extraordinary translation of life into art.
1585,20180033,Three Identical Strangers succeeds far beyond its role as a documentary and even holds the ingredients necessary for a thriller. [Full Review in Spanish]
1586,20180033,The differences between them had to come from somewhere; and in exploring the source; the film gets to the heart of something profound about its three identical strangers; and the rest of us as well.
1587,20180033,The very engaging and thought-provoking Three Identical Strangers does justice to its extraordinary real-life tale and effortlessly proves that reality sure can be stranger - and perhaps even more disturbing - than fiction.
1588,20180033,It's a story that delights and infuriates. It raises questions about justice and ethics; makes cases on both sides of the nature-versus-nurture argument; and draws parallels between what happened to the boys a few short decades ago.
1589,20180033,The film has a thesis; which is incredibly refreshing for a documentary. It wraps up both the narrative it constructed; and offers its audience a little nugget of hope...
1590,20180033,A new addition has joined the already impressive roster of feature-length documentaries this year.
1591,20180033,Director Wardle and his team have an astonishing story to tell. They tackle it in relatively conventional and restrained fashion with talking head interviews; one or two dramatic reconstructions and clever use of archive.
1592,20180033,Entertaining and stimulating as it generally is; Wardle's film keeps bumping its head on a ceiling; conceptually speaking.
1593,20180033,It never loses sight of the three scarred subjects at the core of the tale; and of the sense of profound injustice inflicted on blameless children. Unmissable.
1594,20180033,This haunting documentary uncovers as much of the truth as is possible.
1595,20180033,It combines interviews; archive footage and dramatic reconstructions to take us as close in to the story as possible; not coming to any conclusions. You won't be able to look away.
1596,20180033,"The cliché ""stranger than fiction"" is probably used a little too freely; but this really is that."
1597,20180034,Using footage of his elaborate fashion shows; media coverage; and interviews with colleagues; friends and family; Mcqueen paints a well-rounded portrait of the artist and his work.
1598,20180034,This film presents an incredible amount of archival footage collected by the filmmakers The mix of the music is a little too loud and disturbing at times. But the visuals of McQueen's runway shows are fascinating and fabulous; even through the credits.
1599,20180034,An intimacy infuses everything on-screen; mainly because the people speaking loved him so much; and the footage often features him behind the scenes; revealing himself out of the limelight.
1600,20180034,It poses very valuable questions about the role of the artist and by extension the role of art. [Full Review in Spanish]
1601,20180034,McQueen's filmmakers avoid the melodramatic temptation to explore the tragic fate of the early-disappeared artist. [Full Review in Spanish]
1602,20180034,A handsomely produced; unconventional documentary that's a fitting tribute to its innovative subject.
1603,20180034,"If you have any intention of seeing ""McQueen"" make sure you see it in a theater for full effect."
1604,20180034,McQueen is a haunting biography that goes beyond even that live runway experience to conjure the visionary himself; in as much as he may ever be known - and in a way even his savagely beautiful clothes themselves cannot.
1605,20180034,[The directors] would have done well to shear away the obscuring frills of polite encomiums and pay more attention to the structural details of both the man and what he made.
1606,20180034,The nexus between [McQueen's] work and the personal demons that led him to commit suicide at the age of 40 aren't always clear; but they make for consistently vivid cinema.
1607,20180034,"""McQueen"" doesn't even have to try to make the case for McQueen's brilliance. It's all there; right on the screen; this dude was artistically bonkers in all the right ways."
1608,20180034,McQueen's great legacy is the beauty and skill that lay beneath the compulsion to outrage.
1609,20180035,Featuring trans actress Daniela Vega in a beautiful; formidable performance.
1610,20180035,The film may be groundbreaking in terms of getting attention for community that continues to be misunderstood; but it is the truth with which grief; which is universal; is represented; that audiences will find the greatest; and lasting; connection.
1611,20180035,Vega's performance is a prize for anyone who sees this timely; ground-breaking and moving portrait.
1612,20180035,A Fantastic Woman is a superb character study and a severe indictment of a society that's more hypocritical than open-minded.
1613,20180035,[Daniela] Vega is incredible in all of these scenes; fully occupying the screen with a presence that oscillates from fury to the stark horror of grief.
1614,20180035,The filmmakers pose a powerful and moving question for their worldwide audience: What was Marina's crime?
1615,20180035,An exquisite melodrama about the extremes of love and grief and familial conflict that also; when you're least expecting it; packs a hefty political wallop.
1616,20180035,Fantastic is one word for it; another would be outstanding.
1617,20180035,The director's empathy for the indignities of female solitude remains very much his strong suit.
1618,20180035,A Fantastic Woman asks us to embrace all things fluid and; thanks to the superstar at its centre; it's a pleasure to go with the flow.
1619,20180035,Vega's performance is riveting; but writer and co-director Sebastián Leilo's use of sex and gender to shape his narrative is straight out of a '50s melodrama.
1620,20180035,[Daniela] Vega is mesmerizing as the protagonist.
1621,20180036,Featuring fantastic performances from its cast; sensitive and illuminating direction from director Carla Simon and an assuredly humanistic look on the mindset of a child; Summer 1993 is one of 2018's best films.
1622,20180036,Summer 1993 is such a delicately crafted and deeply moving memoir it is astonishing that this film is Simon Pipó's debut.
1623,20180036,Its depiction of Frida as being at the mercy of powerful emotions she cannot yet comprehend; and how childhood itself is often bittersweet; is universal and timeless.
1624,20180036,A naturally beautiful and uninhibited work; more a filmed photo album of precious memories than a story with a beginning; middle or end.
1625,20180036,Whisked by night from her Barcelona home to a cosy country house; six-year-old Frida is a downcast observer of her unwanted new world. Her parents are dead and she must now find a new way forward with her uncle and his family.
1626,20180036,Its magic and sensibility are conquering spectators from all over the world. [Full Review in Spanish]
1627,20180036,Not since Boyhood has a film shown this much respect and understanding for what it's like to be a child.
1628,20180036,A slow-moving summer; but one worth seeing through.
1629,20180036,The film doesn't detour or disturb; doesn't serpentine or surprise; as great cinema can. It just puts everything on the thematic picnic plate and tells us to get eating.
1630,20180036,In its subtlety; richness and warmth it is entirely beguiling - complex and simple at the same time. It is also very moving.
1631,20180036,Frida's gaze governs everything; taking you back to the mysteries; the insecurities - and the joys - of being six.
1632,20180036,"Refreshingly; Simón's take on the ""summer that changed everything"" movie is delicate and unsentimental; earning an emotional response simply by exploring how a child interprets loss from the child's perspective and at the child's pace."
1633,20180037,Were this to be Schrader's final film; it'd be a fitting coda to his filmography; but the life on display implies he's just getting his second wind.
1634,20180037,Like the best of Schrader's work; First Reformed will burrow under your skin; changing shape as you look at it in different lights.
1635,20180037,This is an emotionally charged work of art that ought to spark debate on religion; big business; suicide and the environment to name just a few.
1636,20180037,It makes astute observations about the state of religion generally in our secular age; as well as the toxic temptations facing Christians particularly.
1637,20180037,"""First Reformed"" is not only a rich and detailed character study; but it also serves as a timely and scathing critique of politics; the church; and society's middle finger to the environment."
1638,20180037,To watch First Reformed is to stare unsparingly into the most basic; unanswerable philosophical questions we have. It is; as Toller says; both exhilarating and exhausting.
1639,20180037,Is it too early to call this Schrader's masterpiece?
1640,20180037,The film is a zinger; with Hawke giving Toller the hungry; doomed conviction of a Graham Greene hero.
1641,20180037,Shaker furniture in movie form - stark; plain; conceived in austere and intelligent good taste; beautifully made; in fact; but maybe more designed for looking at than actually sitting on.
1642,20180037,Yet ultimately it's so good; and the attention to truthfulness so intense; that Schrader writes himself into a narrative dead end and to a conclusion that bounces; within a few short minutes; from shocking to preposterous to silly to schmaltzy.
1643,20180037,Schrader is the divine mortal who wrote Taxi Driver and Raging Bull. He's as passionate as ever; what he has lost is his discipline.
1644,20180037,First Reformed is a bleak; punishing movie and the furthest thing imaginable from an easy crowdpleaser. But Hawke juices it with an austere sense of grace.
1645,20180038,Please go see Free Solo on the biggest screen possible; those of you who've climbed the Lions and the Chief; and yes; those of you who rarely leave the couch.
1646,20180038,Free Solo is a thrillingly entertaining film; filled with unexpected set-backs and triumphs; as well as an appealing personal portrait of a rare and supremely gifted human being.
1647,20180038,Free Solo's value relies basically on its technical difficulties; but without obstacles; fear or doubts; the narrative ends up in need of strength. [Full Review in Spanish]
1648,20180038,Hannold's ultimately selfish act of recklessness is given a hagiographic treatment that feels both irresponsible and emotionally dishonest.
1649,20180038,The film ends with an incredibly captured climbing sequence that is rooted in character.
1650,20180038,Free Solo is a breathtaking film that not only delves into Alex's motivations; but the feelings of the people around him.
1651,20180038,There is something epic and disturbing about Honnold's singularity; his desire to be the one person on the planet who can do something that no one else can.
1652,20180038,Impressive... But the question for me remains: Why on earth would anybody do this?
1653,20180038,A visually dizzying but also thought-provoking film about one man's pinnacle of achievement.
1654,20180038,Free Solo...is a jaw-dropper; both in what is documented and its visual impact.
1655,20180038,The visuals are stunning; offering head-spinning views with the comfort of total safety.
1656,20180038,This awe-inspiring National Geographic documentary is as much a celebration of U.S. parks and wilderness as it is a record of one of the most audacious feats in the history of mountaineering.
1657,20180039,Lee is patient with the story. He illustrates the rather grim reality of how circumstance and people can define you and shape your perception of the world for better or worse.
1658,20180039,Burning is a superior thriller with a double edge - a film that's about a doomed romantic obsession and also a social critique that lays bare the impotency of an outsider seeking to understand the opaque world of the mega rich.
1659,20180039,Lee's screenplay balances the drama and intrigue beautifully; suggesting fully the dangerous volatility of the heart while never stooping to easy; sensationalistic tricks.
1660,20180039,Despite the uneven narrative; Burning is a visually striking slow-burner of a mystery with three intriguing performances.
1661,20180039,Burning is so engrossing it makes you wish you didn't have to blink.
1662,20180039,Lee Chang-dong's masterful pantomime thriller explores treacherously ambiguous borderlands of class and gender.
1663,20180039,"Lee Chang-dong's ""Burning"" will leave you breathless."
1664,20180039,So much ambiguous detail to ponder; while the visual design insidiously marks your memory.
1665,20180039,I like haywire. And Burning; in its sombrely burnished way; is very haywire.
1666,20180039,A twisted love triangle at the core of this Korean thriller...becomes something far more unsettling thanks to a bracing midway plot jolt and a powerful atmosphere of doom and dread created by the director Lee Chang-dong.
1667,20180039,Wave your lighters in the air. This bleak movie is one of the year's best.
1668,20180039,This is the kind of film that all but demands a second viewing in order to appreciate the complex elegance of the design; assembled from details systematically calculated to lend themselves to more than one interpretation.
1669,20180040,The story is most impressive in its use of laptops; computer screens; video chats; and texts as the basis for the entire movie. It's been done before; but never with such success.
1670,20180040,Chaganty combines our primal fears with our internet-based anxieties to deliver one hell of a potboiler.
1671,20180040,The movie's greatest asset is how grounded it feels. During the first half of the film; it truly feels like we're intruding on character's lives.
1672,20180040,[Searching] is very well thought out and constructed.
1673,20180040,[The] film is not only a clever mystery filled with rich characters; but it packs an emotional wallop like few others in the genre due to its harrowing story of a father desperately trying to find his missing daughter.
1674,20180040,While it won't revolutionise the thriller genre; Searching does more than enough with its unique presentation to justify 100 or so minutes of staring at a computer screen.
1675,20180040,For most of its running time; Searching refreshes our screens. Smiley face.
1676,20180040,Some nice moves but as shallow as YouTube celebrity.
1677,20180040,As a drama about a father and a daughter relationship; Searching is nuanced and affecting.
1678,20180040,Searching is a taut; effectively paced mystery-thriller with a powerful emotional component.
1679,20180040,It's done with few words but it's unexpectedly touching; fulfilling the film's key promise - that it's going to make you care about these people; despite the secondhand nature of its delivery system.
1680,20180040,Shot mostly with iPhones and GoPro cameras; the movie is visually drab and a little too gimmicky - ultimately it's a stunt; albeit an engrossing one.
1681,20180041,The screenplay is quite a marvel and [Paul] Dano; adept in his direction; knows how to extract the meaning out of every beat and line.
1682,20180041,Wildlife is an immense first feature that plays like an actor's dream. It lives in the beats between dialogue; capturing something fundamentally human in the process.
1683,20180041,[Paul] Dano has created a period piece that is not very exciting for the first half of the film; but it does paint a picture of a time when men and women had very different roles as they just try to survive.
1684,20180041,It's remarkable how Dano has managed to synthesize the script without being too forced. [Full review in Spanish]
1685,20180041,Wildlife is the inside story of a family burning down; but it is also a tale of toxic masculinity and capitalism's spiritual toll. It's a work that bridges the intimate and expansive with deceptive ease.
1686,20180041,Wildlife connects the current reflection with some of the masterpieces of melodrama of the fifties. [Full Review in Spanish]
1687,20180041,[Dano's] restraint and acute grasp of nuance are mirrored by three outstanding central performances.
1688,20180041,Mulligan trembles like a souffle on the verge of collapse; and her unfortunate son can do little but watch and listen and do his best to grow up much too fast. Truth be told; it's his story - but it's Mulligan's movie.
1689,20180041,"""Wildlife"" is the kind of movie whose low-key hush could get lost in all the buzz over the big-name; holiday-season releases. Sometimes; though; it's the quiet ones who make the most noise."
1690,20180041,"It's a story of its time; unfolding pre-women's lib; and Jeanette feels an inner frustration she can't even give voice to. But as ""Wildlife"" quietly rages; Mulligan lets it be felt."
1691,20180041,Few could play a character so ordinary with as much empathy as Oxenbould brings to the role. He's one to watch; here and in the future.
1692,20180041,There's no shaking the feeling that this sort of study of all-American repression has been done to death.
1693,20180042,The conclusion of Cold War left me anything but cold - I found it to be the sweetest; most romantic ending to a love story ever.
1694,20180042,Kulig dazzles as the poised; fearless; unpredictable Zula. Like a little dynamite she's ready to light up any scene with the sheer force of her joy; rage or pain.
1695,20180042,Its love story is both epic and intimate; personal and political; and one that will haunt you a very long time.
1696,20180042,Resembling Jennifer Lawrence in her early career; Kulig is certainly a talent to watch out for.
1697,20180042,With a running time of 83 minutes; Cold War is the epitome of economic storytelling at its greatest. In that space of time Pawlikowski manages to tell a passionate epic of grandiose scale.
1698,20180042,Borys Szyc offers an Oscar-worthy turn as an ideology-driven devil.
1699,20180042,Pawlikowski remains a director to watch and Cold War is a film to watch again and again.
1700,20180042,"What struck home the most forcefully for me in ""Cold War"" is its depiction; insidious and unrelenting; of how artists under communism suffered for their art. At its best; the film is like a bulletin from a benighted world."
1701,20180042,Heart-thumping: the passion on display is of all sorts; a steady flame against the cold.
1702,20180042,"""Cold War"" captivates and transcends barriers of language and culture. It's a gorgeous tale as rocky as it is romantic."
1703,20180042,[Director Pawel] Pawlikowski movies history along with great economy and visual panache.
1704,20180042,Incredibly sexy. It's nice to see a movie that's actually about passion.
1705,20180043,The film is pervaded by an alternately whimsical and agonizing sense of mystery; one steeped in contradictions of accomplishment and missed opportunity.
1706,20180043,In this sincere; engrossing documentary; director Sandi Tan looks back a quarter of a century at Shirkers; a quirky indie film she helped make that captured a mostly bygone Singapore.
1707,20180043,A quietly radical act of self-love and catharsis - an exorcism of childhood demons that is at once joyful and haunted.
1708,20180043,The fact that everyone knows each other quite well; there is no holding back which gives the film and the story overall an extra added layer of truth despite the main mystery never being told; only speculation is left.
1709,20180043,"Sandi Tan directs a documentary that functions in two levels; one as a self-portrait and one as a mystery story regarding the disappearance and the rediscovery of the film. The great thing about ""Shirkers"" is that both aspects work extremely well;"
1710,20180043,An irresistible mix of insouciance and precocious maturity. Much of its charm lies in Tan's ironic irreverence as the film's narrator.
1711,20180043,A knotty detective yarn; a funny valentine to Singapore and one of the year's most ardent expressions of movie love; it tells a story of cinematic theft; and in the process; becomes an entrancing feat of cinematic reclamation.
1712,20180043,A movie that maintains its forward momentum all the while it's looking back.
1713,20180043,Out of the ashes of the original Shirkers rose the documentary Shirkers; every bit as exceptional as its forebear sought to be.
1714,20180043,The movie is many things at once.
1715,20180043,It's a charming; wistful movie; and I trust Tan will not have to wait another 20 years to direct her next film.
1716,20180043,What Tan has given us is an incredible; sui generis tribute to the international lingua franca of D.I.Y. cinempowerment.
1717,20180044,Deadpool 2 is similar but superior to its predecessor. It is loaded with new characters for Reynolds to play with and brings out a different form (but possibly the best form) from director David Leitch.
1718,20180044,There are gleefully over-the-top fight sequences (often hyperviolent to suit the R rating); too many pop culture references to count; colourful and lovable characters and quips that come at you every second.
1719,20180044,Deadpool 2 is so full of superhero movie in-jokes; one suspects it will be almost incomprehensible in a few years. But for now; this is the franchise we need to deflate all the franchises we probably don't.
1720,20180044,But ultimately I found it frustrating: not quite the film it could and should have been; and too willing to punch down where punching up would serve it better.
1721,20180044,Deadpool 2' repeats the same meta-joke as the first 'Deadpool;' but; thankfully; the joke is still funny.
1722,20180044,Suffice it to say if you liked Deadpool; Deadpool 2 will likely be the funniest film you see all summer.
1723,20180044,Instead of seeking to top the over-the-top antics of the first film; [both director and star are] content to simply groove with what they've already established and just have fun. The result is less exhausting and more entertaining.
1724,20180044,All in all; I prefer a Marvel movie that doesn't take itself seriously; but the nonstop unseriousness of Deadpool 2 can wear you down; too.
1725,20180044,Just as Robert Downey; Jr. has become the definitive Iron Man; Ryan Reynolds is Deadpool. It's the role he was born to play and whenever he's on screen; the movie's inner classic shines forth.
1726,20180044,"For all the impulsive flamboyance of Deadpool's patter; the liberating power of personal virtue; and the disinhibiting promise of second chances; ""Deadpool 2"" feels narrowly impersonal and oppressively unfree."
1727,20180044,Deadpool 2 is an R-rated; potty-mouthed splatterfest and a funny one.
1728,20180044,Everything that you got in the first film; you get times three.
1729,20180045,The premise sounds like a bit of a snore. Four octogenarians get together at a quiet country estate. They have tea in the garden; then go into the house when it starts raining. The end. There's very little action. But there's plenty of drama.
1730,20180045,The real meat of the film is how respectfully it portrays their insane level of talent and knowledge and how refreshingly realistic it is in how it portrays their advanced age.
1731,20180045,No one goes to a movie like this in order to bask in its visual opulence. No; they go to see four legends dish about their professional and personal lives and in that respect; it is undeniably entertaining.
1732,20180045,Eileen Atkins; Judi Dench; Joan Plowright and Maggie Smith chat about their lives; their experience in theatre; TV; film and the memories from when they were ingenues to their present golden years.
1733,20180045,The film also makes points - sometimes subtle; sometimes very frank - about the ways in which women; especially older women; are overlooked and underestimated.
1734,20180045,As splendid as whisky in a teacup.
1735,20180045,While these four actresses are magnificent; their choice of directors is less so; Roger Mitchell (Notting Hill; Hyde Park on the Hudson) makes his biggest contribution by moving the discussion indoors at the sight of rain.
1736,20180045,I guarantee that the appearance of the end credits will leave you wanting much more.
1737,20180045,We're offered the precious illusion that we're close enough with four pillars of English theatre that they're chatting to us about their memories and feelings; that we get to see them as people and as friends.
1738,20180045,A delightful; delicate; delicious crustless-finger-sandwich of a film...
1739,20180045,Candid; insightful and unpredictable; Dame Eileen Atkins; Dame Judi Dench; Dame Joan Plowright and Dame Maggie Smith are not only acting legends but also great friends. And a treat to hang out with.
1740,20180045,[A] cozy nonfiction film.
1741,20180046,Abbasi; Melander; and Milonoff are not afraid to cross into bizarre territory.
1742,20180046,A beautiful fantasy film enclosed in a thriller. This is just how folklore oriented films should be. [Full review in Spanish].
1743,20180046,This original and mercilessly intense fairy tale is simply unmissable.
1744,20180046,Border is a fascinating movie; irresistible and intriguing because of its marginalization. [Full Review in Spanish]
1745,20180046,In all groups there are individuals who act in ways that harm or benefit others; and this is how Border proposes itself in an intelligent and very creative way. [Full review in Spanish]
1746,20180046,The ending; surprising for its particular hopeful message; is one of the strong elements of this wild movie. [Full Review in Spanish]
1747,20180046,Excellent modern fairy tale of identity and otherness.
1748,20180046,Beneath her layers of make-up and prosthetics; [Eva] Melander gives a fine and moving performance as the customs officer with the unlikely powers.
1749,20180046,Here is a story that upturns all the usual questions; never mind the traditional or notional answers.
1750,20180046,The strangeness in this film writhes like bacteria.
1751,20180046,There are bits of everything in here: gender studies; fairytales; myth and sci-fi. It's profoundly preposterous; but delivered at all times with a deliciously straight face.
1752,20180046,I found this compelling as I watched it; though I don't feel I gained much from the experience.
1753,20180047,The framing of what happened to Jenny is flexible; expansive; interested in complication; the perspective is enigmatic; deeply personal; at once singular and manifold; insular and diffuse.
1754,20180047,The Tale is distressing and compelling; a film for the #MeToo movement that reckons with personal relationships and inflicted trauma.
1755,20180047,The Tale is a powerful film that would get greater accolades if released widely
1756,20180047,An extraordinary piece of storytelling and a daring confessional. You've seen nothing like it before.
1757,20180047,The Tale is a deeply personal and at times hard-to-watch story of a woman coming to terms with her own sexual assault as a child.
1758,20180047,By emphasising how little Fox could trust her memory; The Tale forces us to discern that when someone is assaulted; so is their mind - blocking their own memories becomes not only their language; but also their instant cure.
1759,20180047,Fox's movie renders the reconsideration of the personal past inseparable from reconsiderations of the historical past-and so; of cultural objects from the past that exert enduring power today.
1760,20180047,Even viewed from the sofa; it makes an IMAX-sized impact.
1761,20180047,It is; instead; a startlingly effective act of fiction; in which [Jennifer] Fox turns her abuser into an accessory in her own narrative; a means to an ending.
1762,20180047,The Tale is lit up by a clarifying anger; but it has a stirring; inspiring streak-it's about mastering a story by finding the right way to tell it.
1763,20180047,"Jenny's reluctance to stare down the horror gives ""The Tale"" an ineluctable psychological power."
1764,20180047,Jennifer Fox's autobiographical debut makes for harrowing but essential viewing.
1765,20180048,A family drama whose deviations as a thriller make you wait in frustration for a turn that drives you to be interested; get excited or feel something. [Full Review in Spanish]
1766,20180048,A mostly joyless experience; Loveless nonetheless makes a compelling argument that a life's regrets are more intrinsically linked to life's rewards.
1767,20180048,It's a wrenching; deeply thoughtful film that; once it casts its spell; makes it impossible to turn away.
1768,20180048,Loveless is a bit thick to swallow; but highly rewarding.
1769,20180048,With cinema; more than life; we are used to an artificial sense of resolution; but this film refuses to offer an easy sense of completion. And if that leaves a knot in your stomach; then Loveless has done its job.
1770,20180048,A fascinating if heart-breaking study.
1771,20180048,"The whole story can be seen as a metaphor for Putin's Russia and the way the country has lost its humanity. ""Loveless"" is as bleak and harsh as the tundra."
1772,20180048,Everything here - from the image to the dialogue to the landscape to the film's vision and judgment - is clean; cold; and bracing.
1773,20180048,"""Loveless;"" which is Ingmar Bergman's ""Scenes from a Marriage"" dipped in battery acid; is a master class in melancholy."
1774,20180048,Loveless is about a state of mind; a lament; an indictment of crimes against the human spirit.
1775,20180048,It's a kind of thriller; but without easy resolution. Zvyagintsev does not deal in reassurance: there is none to be had in this cold; hard place.
1776,20180048,The director may be a master at setting a mood; but his insights here don't cut especially deep.
1777,20180049,[A] captivating story. [Full review in Spanish]
1778,20180049,Here; physical space creates a figurative space of mental anguish; so while the protagonist tries to avert an exterior crisis he's swallowed whole by his own internal turmoil.
1779,20180049,The Guilty works better as an experiment than a full movie. There just isn't enough going on that's interesting to keep the audience engaged.
1780,20180049,Writer-director Gustav Müller's feature-film debut is a nerve-shredding hell on wheels.
1781,20180049,First-time director Gustav Möller is able to overcome the cookie cutter plot to reveal some hard truths about law enforcement.
1782,20180049,Combining Sorry; Wrong Number's radio-drama appeal and Locke's claustrophobic tension; The Guilty might be the best film of [the 2018 Florida Film Festival].
1783,20180049,Godard said that all you need to make a film is a girl and a gun. Well; with his smart and mercilessly gripping abduction thriller; the Danish director Gustav Möller has pulled it off with a middle-aged man and a hands-free phone.
1784,20180049,The Guilty stays afloat; but it never builds to the armrest-clutching peaks of suspense that the premise promises.
1785,20180049,Make the right call and watch this immediately.
1786,20180049,"""The Guilty"" is a nerve-wracking exercise in tension that also manages to reveal itself in layers; leaving assumptions dashed on the floor."
1787,20180049,The Guilty is a clever Danish thriller that takes full advantage of the strengths and weaknesses of modern communications.
1788,20180049,This Danish potboiler is organized around a few nimbly executed plot twists; and like many similarly designed thrillers; it leaves the audience with little to think about once all the surprises have been revealed.
1789,20180050,Annihilation is a shining example of what scifi can be when the narrative hinges on one woman and the world-altering decision she must make: Do I save my world; or not?
1790,20180050,Even as it relies on horror tropes for shape Annihilation's mission is to plumb the depths of Lovecraftian existential fear.
1791,20180050,Annihilation is a smart and intelligent movie. It's super ambitious and maybe a bit tedious. The movie requires patience and at times gets a bit too showy.
1792,20180050,A seriously intelligent; and visually stunning; picture that benefits from its bold structure and dedicated female cast.
1793,20180050,Annihilation shares the ambiguous dream logic found in David Lynch's best work; but mixes it with the type of horrific imagery seen in Alien and The Thing.
1794,20180050,Annihilation works as much for the few moments of genuine terror as it does for the fascinating conversations that occur as these women use their skill sets to deduce what is going on around them.
1795,20180050,The movie may be cerebral; but it also packs a gut punch.
1796,20180050,Garland's version is a worthy mutation.
1797,20180050,Top-notch sci-fi and a chilling allegory for humanity's capacity for self-destruction.
1798,20180050,Portman's high-tension acting; her inability to relax; suits the material down to the ground. It's one of her best performances ...
1799,20180050,It's audacious stuff; topped by a lovely twist ending; and deserving of more than a casual skim through on an iPad.
1800,20180050,It's certain that the astonishing special effects would have worked better on a larger cinema screen; and it's a shame to lose their impact. But the dialogue is clunky and the plot disjointed.
1801,20180051,Gadsby turns comedy on its head.
1802,20180051,It becomes so much more than stand-up... Very sophisticated; and something that I wasn't expecting.
1803,20180051,What follows is a tour de force of comedy as in-your-face truth-telling. And it moves well beyond the unwritten rules of the laugh-a-minute; observational and adolescent-inflected stand-up that has long dominated the form.
1804,20180051,She also claps back against the idols of her early life; men like Louis C.K. who've now become the problem. In other words; Gadsby's not holding any punches with this one.
1805,20180051,Gadsby grabs your attention with jokes and then slowly and expertly peels back layers to reveal a deep well of shame and anger.
1806,20180051,Gadsby realized that turning her pain into comedy actually forced her to create a specific narrative of her own life that she repeated night after night until it became her reality.
1807,20180051,Gadsby explains how comedy works; how tension is broken to bring relief. By the end; there is no relief for the audience. But perhaps there is some for Gadsby. After years of telling jokes; she is finally telling her story.
1808,20180051,You can believe this was a show that existed only in this moment and you feel elevated from being a part of it.
1809,20180051,I am also exactly who this special is for. For Gadsby's fury is directed at people like me with laser-like acumen; humor and sobering grace.
1810,20180051,Gadsby is tired of censoring her own pain for the sake of making audiences feel comfortable. Nanette is a testament to this. It's time to make audiences feel uncomfortable in order to wake them up.
1811,20180051,When Gadsby wrenches out her pain on stage; she reveals her strength; rage; and yes; winning humor.
1812,20180051,Hannah Gadsby spins her own life story into a clever; raging and confronting spiel against misogyny; homophobia and even the tired old tropes of comedy itself.
1813,20180052,...pays special attention to tender touches.
1814,20180052,It has a positive force playing out as a revenge thriller.
1815,20180052,There is nothing new or striking here; but rather emphatically emotional; in a film about decisions that never quite convinces in terms of hypothetical revenge.
1816,20180052,...a tough but rewarding watch
1817,20180052,An impressive directorial debut for Jordana Spiro; and a powerful showcase for two young actresses with a bright future ahead of them.
1818,20180052,Here's hoping both [director Jordana Spiro] and co-screenwriter [Angelica] Nwandu get a chance to prove themselves again soon.
1819,20180052,A film that balances penetrating clarity with compassion.
1820,20180052,Fortunately; Night Comes On continues to dial back its sense of drama for its long-awaited final confrontations; which offer open endings that hint at a future worth pursuing.
1821,20180052,"Like its determined heroine; ""Night Comes On"" burns with a smoldering fire; a heat that is no less intense; no less effective; for remaining largely beneath the surface."
1822,20180052,Though slow; it's intense; and you're hooked from its first scene... to its last; wrenching image. Spiro is a real filmmaker.
1823,20180052,An unusual and interesting feature that tries to convey the inner state of a non-communicative young woman mainly through reaction shots of her face.
1824,20180052,The quest-plot puts a solid frame around what's essentially a sensitive study of a shattered family; poorly served by the social institutions meant to keep them safe.
1825,20180053,With Hailee Steinfeld impressively leading the action blockbuster; this new telling of an old tale is a refreshing change.
1826,20180053,Your kids will probably love it but there's not enough here for hardcore fans to appreciate and; as a blockbuster; Bumblebee sadly falls short in a month with far better offerings.
1827,20180053,Energetic and a whole lot of fun.
1828,20180053,This sort of unhinged passion could've greatly benefited Bumblebee. It's all just far too by the book and safe; a dull pledge from an uncertain committee of movie executives to do better with the Transformers' mythos in future instalments.
1829,20180053,It's incredibly well done; backed by powerful emotions; it's fun and funny; and genuinely great for all ages.
1830,20180053,Bumblebee has become the thing that people criticised the Bay films for being - a mere cash grab for cash grabs sake. Look; Bumblebee isn't bad. It's also not good. It's just middle of the road serviceable.
1831,20180053,Imagine if John Hughes made a Transformers movie. Or: Think E.T.; but with auto parts.
1832,20180053,The movie works in large part because of the depth of Steinfeld's performance. We haven't seen such a well-realized character in any of the other Transformers movies.
1833,20180053,If only not being terrible was the same as being good; Bumblebee is still just reheated nostalgia.
1834,20180053,A frustrating joy ride. It'd be twice as good if it was half as long.
1835,20180053,"Where the Bay ""Transformers"" movies alternated between ecstasy and dullness; ""Bumblebee"" is consistently middling."
1836,20180053,The film presents late-80s America so fetishistically that it feels at times like a follow-up to Bennett Miller's Foxcatcher (2014); and its recycling of 80s teen-movie cliches are also weirdly reverential.
1837,20180054,"Will doubtlessly be a crowd-pleaser for the justice's legions of fans; but it will also be an illuminating piece of history for those who only know her as the ""great dissenter"" liberal hero."
1838,20180054,A super documentary about a modern-day superhero.
1839,20180054,Beyond notorious.
1840,20180054,For inspiration; you can't beat this film; or its subject.
1841,20180054,It's a superhero movie with a twist.
1842,20180054,The filmmakers' justifiable admiration for Ginsburg is clear; perhaps to the detriment of getting inside the mind of its subject rather than merely celebrating it.
1843,20180054,At the same time; although West and Cohen get around to the version of Ginsburg that has become a meme for Millennials and a symbol of resistance; the greater part of the film celebrates her tireless determination.
1844,20180054,"The documentary makes us grateful for the truth that ""It takes all sorts to make a world"" - and for the fact that RBG may be staunchest bulwark against the unmaking of that world; in the present American political moment."
1845,20180054,This lively film tracks Ginsburg's brilliant legal career; fighting for women's workplace rights while shrewdly also taking on cases where men suffered discrimination.
1846,20180054,RBG isn't a critical portrait of its subject but an enlightening and affectionate one.
1847,20180054,"The life and work of the associate justice of the US Supreme Court; Ruth Bader Ginsburg (aka ""the notorious RBG"") is the subject of this dense; inspiring and often playful panegyric."
1848,20180054,Her determination and self-belief are inspiring. She's convinced she still has much to offer. Only a cruel fool would disagree.
1849,20180055,Blindspotting is enjoyable and entertaining while offering a sober look at some of the things facing our young; black male population; especially in urban settings.
1850,20180055,What feels like the most slept-on film of 2018; Blindspotting is; above all else; a magnificent performance piece.
1851,20180055,Intense performances shine the spotlight on race; poverty; police shootings; guns; education and more current issues in a well paced; well placed; dark comedy capped with a stunning climactic rap poetry slam.
1852,20180055,The issues of living in an American city circa 2018-from the justice system to gentrification-tied up with a little poetry; a little anxiety; and a whole lot of Oakland flavor.
1853,20180055,Blindspotting is 95 minutes long; with tight storytelling of a truly compelling narrative that is made all the more intense with the pace it is told at. It's one of reasons it was my favourite film of 2018.
1854,20180055,What Paul Haggis tried to do with CRASH; BLINDSPOTTING does; putting the Best Picture winner to shame while doing it.
1855,20180055,Racism; gentrification; police brutality; start-up culture; corporate branding; social media; the justice system ... Blindspotting is eager to take them all on with style and wit; and it succeeds more often than not.
1856,20180055,The film's spell grows and grows; perhaps because we're not sure exactly what the writers and first-time director Carlos López Estrada are preaching or promoting.
1857,20180055,Try and take your electrified eyes off it. It's practically 2018: The Movie.
1858,20180055,It's acted with naturalistic brio and the script; by Diggs and Casal; is full of pungent dialogue and nuanced reflections on Collin's struggle to avoid becoming a stereotypically angry young black man.
1859,20180055,Reportedly 10 years in the making; Blindspotting is a refreshingly original; gritty and stylised version of the typical rites-of-passage story.
1860,20180055,A mercurial and explosive film; Blindspotting nimbly parses conflicts about race; rent; incarceration and gentrification.
1861,20180056,It is a different thriller; and version of the stories of urban justice; that goes beyond what has been seen so far. [Full Review in Spanish]
1862,20180056,Joaquin Phoenix's performance in this film is gritty gold and bold.
1863,20180056,It's necessary and exact. She has ripped the black heart out and slapped it on the table; and we can't look away; though we might want to. It's a must-see.
1864,20180056,The film is an endurance test at times; but it's breathtakingly shot; capturing the beauty in the grim.
1865,20180056,Ramsay's You Were Never Really Here lands on the difficulties in overcoming irreparable damage caused by trauma and abuse in beautiful but abstract visual fragments.
1866,20180056,Ramsay keeps it brisk and brutal; putting her arthouse sensitivities to mesmerizing use in a theatrically heightened setting. She really directed the hell out of this thing.
1867,20180056,With You Were Never Really Here; writer/director Lynne Ramsay has created a spectacular cinematic journey that will remain in audience's memories far into awards season.
1868,20180056,As an intense; ruthless thriller; You Were Never Really Here ticks the boxes in terms of narrative; style and acting.
1869,20180056,[Lynne] Ramsay finds poetry in the abject to her detriment but to her credit too.
1870,20180056,Ramsay's work is as chilling as it is technically flawless.
1871,20180056,A beautifully brutal piece of cinema that is guaranteed to stay with you after the credits roll.
1872,20180056,An arresting; disorienting and traumatic film; Ramsay's latest work is a difficult but incomparable thriller.
1873,20180057,The movie is idealistic and corny; but by the end; I was laughing and crying along with it.
1874,20180057,It's a sincere coming-of-age tale with an accomplished cast that brings teens to life realistically and emotionally.
1875,20180057,At its heart; this is simply a story about love and tolerance and honesty; and told with a perfect dose of each of those things.
1876,20180057,I had a lot of problems with this movie.
1877,20180057,It was very convoluted.
1878,20180057,This is a sweet and moving film that is built for all; but I'm guessing it will make a lot of gay teens see the world as a safer; more compassionate place for them.
1879,20180057,With its sheer warmth; openness; likability and idealism; Love; Simon won me over.
1880,20180057,Love; Simon - I really did.
1881,20180057,How heartening that a mainstream studio flick could have a gay protagonist. How disappointing that said flick is as twee and anodyne as this.
1882,20180057,Despite...strangely misjudged moments; Love; Simon succeeds in navigating most of the pitfalls of the gay coming-of-age narrative and is ultimately moving and genuine.
1883,20180057,Sweet and moving as it often manages to be; the film is comfortingly average; in its way - the point of it not to stand out; but fit in.
1884,20180057,This beguiling romantic comedy offers a fresh take on the familiar premise of a high-schooler trying to fit in.
1885,20180058,The inspired moments in Buster Scruggs and the thought provoking arcs in the proceedings are testament to the Coen brothers' filmmaking talent.
1886,20180058,Many of us god-fearing reg'lar folk expect a twist at the closing of a short story; but life ain't like that on the frontiers of the Coen brothers' imagination; no sirree.
1887,20180058,In a world where the reality of death is increasingly avoided or hidden from view; [Buster Scruggs is] oddly sobering. Remembering death matters.
1888,20180058,Combining their trademark wit with comedic violence and tense drama; The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is a delightful return to form for the Coens.
1889,20180058,On an artistic level; The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is an unreserved success.
1890,20180058,Whether you like the Coen brothers or not; of if you really love Westerns or not; there is a story in this anthology film to be appreciated and enjoyed by anyone who's looking for something unusual; or just a really great story.
1891,20180058,After a darkly hilarious musical number; the Buster story loses steam in its goofy closing moments - but that's OK; it's time to move on to the next chapter!
1892,20180058,The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is the perfect Coen Brothers' movie; albeit sliced and diced.
1893,20180058,Those wacky Coens are at it again. And those serious Coens. And those loquacious Coens.
1894,20180058,"There is so much to enjoy in The Ballad of Buster Scruggs that I can't help but (mostly) forgive those shortcomings. Any film that has a man insisting that ""people are like ferrets"" is all right by me."
1895,20180058,Though the stories are individually captivating and very much worth the price of admission-see the film on a big screen if you can-they fit together awkwardly.
1896,20180058,As with the Coens' oeuvre on the whole; the various stories are unified by an impressive sense of craft and a lamentable sense of smugness.
1897,20180059,Mandy is deadly serious about loss and it conjures the kind of blackly ridiculous; balls-out campy imagery that puts other action/arthouse flicks to shame. Its influences are obvious; but it's a one of a kind.
1898,20180059,Cage is exceptional and more memorable than past performances; but this is only due to the world that Cosmatos has crafted for him to coexist within.
1899,20180059,The film at times does feel like death metal band's music video but throughout; the story seems to be as if it was lifted directly from the pages of a dark fantasy novel; similar to the one Mandy reads in the film.
1900,20180059,... there is a sense of raw filmmaking and imagery herein coupled with throwbacks to 1980s post-apocalypse sci-fi and fantasy; but the underfunded and under-edited final cut drags like a battleship anchor holding back a rowboat.
1901,20180059,Bizarre revenge horror movie has graphic violence; gore.
1902,20180059,Mandy is a mostly fun movie but while the character and relationship building is good; it feels like it takes a bit too much time and leaves too little time to the mayhem.
1903,20180059,There really are some extraordinary scenes.
1904,20180059,Fans of [Cage's] work will relish his extravagantly oddball performance as a dark avenger in this luridly overwrought horror movie.
1905,20180059,Needless to say; Cage is utterly in his element.
1906,20180059,Naughty but niche.
1907,20180059,It's bloody; it's nasty; and it burns.
1908,20180059,I didn't much care for the film; but I can see how it might appeal to gorehounds and fans of genre cinema.
1909,20180060,It's a comedy of errors of bleakly dystopian existentialism; the farce of his successes leading him right where we thought his failures would nothing short of brilliant.
1910,20180060,A film that is haunting; baffling; and frustrating in equal measure.
1911,20180060,Martel tackles the inherent contradictions of colonialism and its destructive history by subtly tweaking its practitioners with sly humor and a devastating satirical eye.
1912,20180060,Where the coconuts are.
1913,20180060,Languishing in a godforsaken; 18th-century South American colony; pining for his family and desperate beyond measure to be gone; magistrate Don Diego de Zama is in fact going precisely nowhere.
1914,20180060,Zama is that rarest of creative feats: a perfect coupling of literary source material and cinematic sensibility.
1915,20180060,Martel has made a woozy epic about the toxicity of torpor.
1916,20180060,"Some movies unfold as dreams; ""Zama"" dances us playfully toward the edge of nightmare and then asks us to open our eyes."
1917,20180060,You have to find your own way through Zama; slowed down by the tropical torpor that hangs over the whole film. The pace is languid; the style is cryptic and the mood is downbeat; to say the least.
1918,20180060,Told in the typically oblique style of Argentinian director Lucrecia Martel; this adaptation of Antonio di Benedetto's novel is nonetheless a pointed fable about the futility of colonialism.
1919,20180060,This blackly funny-and ultimately haunting-examination of colonial history is thoroughly characteristic in its brilliant manipulation of physical space.
1920,20180060,"As an existential objet d'art Zama stands as a serious achievement. But that won't prevent even the most sophisticated of cinephiles from staggering out of the theater; wondering ""What in the world did I just see?"""
1921,20180061,In Between (Bar Bahar) will confuse you; entertain you; shock you with its honesty and put you face to face with your own subtle prejudice or misconceptions about life for the women of Israel.
1922,20180061,During an era where so many of us are desperately looking for comfort; I can think of no cinematic message more fitting for 2018 than this one.
1923,20180061,As an angry; impassioned work of socio-political cinema; In Between is highly commendable and it's safe to say that it's going to take a lot more than a fatwa to stop Maysaloun Hamoud fulfilling the promise of this impressive debut.
1924,20180061,The trio of women are nothing short of spectacular; but Kanboura (Nur) is a standout.
1925,20180061,The film alternates between the contrasting environments in an upbeat flow; infused with humor and irony; while accurately depicting the crises of a generation torn schizophrenically between two unfavorable worlds.
1926,20180061,This brave and artistic entry deserves a better fate.
1927,20180061,[A] sharp; wise and vibrant ode to female independence ...
1928,20180061,An engaging; revelatory slice of life; In Between follows three Palestinian women in Tel Aviv - kind of a Sex and the City and Girls for the Arab set.
1929,20180061,There's a double meaning to the title of this intriguing and defiantly feminist film out of the Middle East.
1930,20180061,In Between highlights how difficult it will be to make substantive change in the world's most patriarchal societies.
1931,20180061,"Although ""In Between"" depicts a nation in crisis; it's a crisis that's viewed through the intimate lens of family dinners; where generations struggle over conflicting values."
1932,20180061,There are no easy resolutions here; but Hamoud makes clear that these women - troubled though they may be - will stand strong and defiant and together.
1933,20180062,A delicate film that perfectly encapsulates love in its many forms; never favouring one story over another.
1934,20180062,There is no word in our lexicon for the conundrum so tenderly and lovingly; yet truthfully plated in The Cake Maker; not one; not one hundred.
1935,20180062,It's comforting like a sweet dessert.
1936,20180062,[A] simple; yet monumental debut film.
1937,20180062,An intriguing and atmospheric drama from the debut of the middle-aged Israeli writer-director Ofir Raul Graizer.
1938,20180062,It's to the credit of the small cast that the film's slow pace doesn't become oppressive
1939,20180062,"Graizer take his time and never feels the need to spell everything out; and ""The Cakemaker"" is a testament to what filmmakers can achieve when they trust the audience."
1940,20180062,Kalkhof has perfect chemistry with both Miller and Adler. The characters don't have to talk for the audience to feel the loss; love and desire they're experiencing.
1941,20180062,The Cakemaker is a movie of subtle; melancholy pleasures.
1942,20180062,A tender; tactile and just-sweet-enough story of hidden love; challenged faith and unwittingly shared grief.
1943,20180062,Credit first-time writer/director Ofir Raul Graizer with pulling off something of a miracle.
1944,20180062,Natural performances from Kalkhof and Adler root the melodrama in genuine pathos.
1945,20180063,Its intensity is too artfully channelled ever to turn into poignancy.
1946,20180063,It's a clever; funny; unsettling film.
1947,20180063,A heavy-handed approach to the futility of war; Foxtrot aims high but falls short
1948,20180063,For a film with only three characters; Foxtrot contains a lot of twists and turns. Right up until the bitterly cruel final scene; it never stops surprising. Or perhaps it's a wickedly funny final scene. It's a matter of perspective.
1949,20180063,The absolute precision of the film's construction; from sound; to production design; to cinematography; to the performances is exquisite; and painful because of it.
1950,20180063,Foxtrot benefits from a talented supporting cast.
1951,20180063,It's an extraordinary film; far from easy; ultimately thoughtful and hard to forget.
1952,20180063,Before the retrospective letdown; there is an exhilarating kind of disorientation as we move from one narrative section to the next.
1953,20180063,Maoz creates a deadpan J'accuse; razor-edged and hugely original. The truth? It is unmissable.
1954,20180063,Maoz definitely knows how to knock a film together; so fingers crossed that the window between this and his next one is a lot more narrow.
1955,20180063,A film full of mystery and switchbacks is resolved in resounding style.
1956,20180063,[Writer-director Samuel] Moaz is a daring; unpredictable storyteller; and his eccentric plot construction; which also takes into account the son's last days; turns an intimate emotional drama into a larger statement about fate and justice.
1957,20180064,Science Fair is the perfect remedy for those suffering from 2018's anti-intellectual crisis.
1958,20180064,Science Fair is cute; fun; and inspiring; but let's not kid ourselves: we've seen this documentary a million times before.
1959,20180064,It's one of the best documentaries of the year.
1960,20180064,'Science Fair' is an outstanding documentary featuring brilliantly entertaining teenagers from around the world.
1961,20180064,"Also; fascinatingly; none of the people showcased exhibit the stereotypical; awkward ""nerdiness"" you might expect from a giant academic event like this."
1962,20180064,These young students deserve a moment in the spotlight now; and Costantini and Foster do much to illuminate a wider message that should be heeded.
1963,20180064,There's a certain amount of tension in the proceedings but; as various participants point out; what counts isn't so much winning as it is having the experience.
1964,20180064,The milieu is intense; the stakes are high; and the science prodigies themselves are fascinating.
1965,20180064,"""Science Fair"" is a celebration of intellect and kids who want to improve the world. Turns out science is pretty cool; after all."
1966,20180064,I loved it.
1967,20180064,Our heroes develop complex science projects. They cruise to the finals. Excellence is celebrated. Yet the film; though perfectly competent; never quite matches the sheer inventiveness of its young Einsteins.
1968,20180064,Science Fair may not necessitate a big-screen experience; but there are far lesser ways to spend your study break.
1969,20180065,Disney continues to shine with its animation and this is apparent in Ralph Breaks the Internet.
1970,20180065,Ralph Breaks the Internet skewers its many online targets with a lot of wicked wit.
1971,20180065,Ralph Breaks The Internet comes across as a lifeless cash grab designed to promote every single brand known to man. There are some creative ideas; but the heart of the first film is completely gone.
1972,20180065,There are dozens and dozens of internet meme callouts; appearances by YouTube celebrities like Dani Fernandez; Colleen Ballinger[...But the best part of Wreck-It Ralph 2 really is the story of growth between Ralph and Vanellope.
1973,20180065,Ralph Breaks the Internet is sweet; funny and clever; proving that Disney can create something more relatable than your typical fairytale.
1974,20180065,It's charming and self-aware; but not enough to really elevate Ralph Breaks The Internet beyond a routine kid-pleasing pot boiler.
1975,20180065,It's pretty incredible to see how the filmmakers easily and boldly slip concepts right from the therapist's office into the wild rumpus through the internet.
1976,20180065,Surprisingly enjoyable; if not predictable.
1977,20180065,The nuanced friendship between Ralph and Vanellope remains the most engaging part of the film; once you've overcome the slight weirdness of a hulking man being best mates with a small girl.
1978,20180065,Best of all; the directors don't shy away from the ending their story demands.
1979,20180065,Conceptually; it's rather ingenious; with well-aimed barbs at abusive commenter culture and social-media narcissism that adds up to a welcome moral for small fry...
1980,20180065,Movies don't get more timely than Ralph Breaks the Internet - an exhilarating yet dismaying sequel to 2012's Wreck It Ralph; for my money easily the smartest and most endearing Disney animated feature of recent years.
1981,20180066,Custody is heartbreaking; but never feels manipulative; thanks to the believable performances.
1982,20180066,[Custody] packs a concentrated gut punch of tension and trauma as he chronicles the fallout of a divorce that has turned from bitter to septic.
1983,20180066,More than most horror movies; this will make you want to scream at the screen. And it should produce those reactions; at least for those with a beating heart in their chest.
1984,20180066,Writer-director Xavier Legrand's confronting debut feature grabs the hot-potato topic of domestic violence and runs to the depths of hell with it.
1985,20180066,It demands a certain predisposition to assume the extreme simplicity of the story; its development without surprises and its relatively plane characters [Full Review in Spanish].
1986,20180066,[Legrand's] screenplay bravely explores the darker side of spousal separation; the use of children as weapons and domestic violence; all of which elevate this simple drama to something quite terrifying.
1987,20180066,Legrand... seems precociously adept at turning the screws of suspense...
1988,20180066,As in all good movies of this kind; the ordeal of the children is not skimped. They bear the brunt; and the legacy; of the anguish.
1989,20180066,Legrand in his feature debut shows laudable technical ability and discipline.
1990,20180066,Custody makes gripping drama from a difficult subject.
1991,20180066,Mr. Legrand is skilled in the techniques of dread and suspense; and without sensationalizing or cheapening the story; he gives this closely observed drama the tension and urgency of a thriller.
1992,20180066,This is taut; engrossing filmmaking on a crucial subject.
1993,20180067,Terajima's 'Lucy' magnificently wields the full spectrum of emotions to deliver an imperfect character that's broken yet still willing and able to heal.
1994,20180067,It is a strong first feature from director Atsuko Hirayanagi; and an excellent showcase for the considerable talent of actress Shinobu Terajima.
1995,20180067,The writer-director uses one woman's life as a bizarre-but-funny vessel for humans' capacity for change.
1996,20180067,In watching Setsuko as she drops away mask after mask; we can consider doing that for ourselves.
1997,20180067,Slight and tonally awkward. I wasn't expecting Josh Harnett (of all people) to pop up in a Japanese movie.
1998,20180067,A 96-minute culture-shock excursion that's hilarious at times.
1999,20180067,It's weird; sometimes challenging and surprisingly engaging; thanks in large part to Terajima; who is outstanding.
2000,20180067,An idiosyncratic character study suggesting that the road to self-knowledge is beset with obstacles and uncertainties.
2001,20180067,Nothing here is wrapped up with a red ribbon the way it would be in an American film; studio made or otherwise. Oh Lucy! has the guts to leave things messy and unkempt; just like life.
2002,20180067,At its best; it's a comedy of miscommunication; one that hits an occasional rough spot when the location shifts from Tokyo to SoCal and a chase ensues between Lucy and her mother and sister. 2017.
2003,20180067,Oh Lucy! is quirky and offbeat and strange and sometimes quite dark - and yet oddly lovable.
2004,20180067,As willful; selfish; and cruel as Ferrell's screen dunces; [Shinobu Terajima] blunders into one humiliating situation after another; hardly sympathetic but never less than human.
2005,20180068,Warwick Thornton's outback morality tale; Sweet Country; combines exquisite visuals of Australian landscapes with a script that dabbles as much in mythical justice as deeply specific ideas of what this country is made of.
2006,20180068,Uncomfortable to watch; the film works as a distinguished; forceful statement on integrity; authority; and bigotry and is a strong entry for the genre.
2007,20180068,A piece of cinema that will both enrage and inspire you; Sweet Country is a true triumph of cinema.
2008,20180068,Not only is Sweet Country a superb genre film; its focus on Aboriginal lives... makes it more than a little revolutionary. Most US Westerns fail at their indigenous representation; and this Aussie film is here to show them how it's done.
2009,20180068,Sweet Country is a powerful drama boasting strong performances; an engrossing story; and a viewing experience not easily shaken off.
2010,20180068,"""The fourth feature by Australian filmmaker Thornton is not just the surprise of the week. It can even be the year; even though it has been released in our country with more than a year of delay""."
2011,20180068,In a milieu where; the dialogue repeatedly suggests; madness has become the defining condition of the white colonizer; the dispassionate unforgiving beauty of these landscapes-of a country that's often far from sweet-comes to embody its own bleak sanity.
2012,20180068,A bleak story presented with great style; it's a finely made Australian western that demonstrates the malleability of that most American of genres as well as the impressive gifts of Indigenous filmmaker Warwick Thornton.
2013,20180068,Spare; deliberately paced; and almost Biblical in its search for moral justice in a harsh and lawless landscape.
2014,20180068,Australia now has its High Noon.
2015,20180068,If the movie's outlook is less than hopeful; it nevertheless suggests that there is still time to learn from our mistakes.
2016,20180068,Indigenous actor Hamilton Morris is quietly magnificent in his first screen role.
2017,20180069,Ross' film is merely an artistic glimpse of a life; and a community; that most of us will never see firsthand; but a life put in a perspective that we can all understand: sometimes joyous; sometimes mundane and sometimes utterly; utterly sad.
2018,20180069,An essential and utterly fascinating look at what it means to be black; to be American; and ultimately to be human.
2019,20180069,It's not for everyone; but if you give it a chance; it's possible you might end up with; at least; an image or moment engraved in your brain. [Full review in Spanish]
2020,20180069,...a transcendental and immersive documentary assembled by RaMell Ross...
2021,20180069,An intriguing and artistically-styled documentary that is mostly deserving of the critical praise.
2022,20180069,Hale County illustrates the sad truth of just how much of America; especially but not only the rural South; is still almost entirely segregated.
2023,20180069,Hale County is a kind of mini-epochal calendar art; turning its seasonal pages. With a heavier hand it would have become tendentious or messagey.
2024,20180069,There is something visionary in this film.
2025,20180069,At every juncture; Ross elects for ambiguity and poses a question to the viewer to answer how black bodies are viewed; encouraging the audience to perform the labour of challenging their expectations.
2026,20180069,There are moments of genuine lyricism.
2027,20180069,A visually mesmerizing but only half-illuminating documentary on black lives in the Deep South.
2028,20180069,RaMell Ross's remarkable debut feature is as much an experimental film as it is a documentary; and it succeeds smashingly on both fronts.
2029,20180070,A well-intentioned; good-natured teen romance that plays it safe and ends up being blander than it should have been.
2030,20180070,Don't sleep on this movie just because it's familiar-save for a lead character and actor blazing a trail for diversity-To All The Boys I've Loved Before is a crush-worthy movie that will have your heart swooning.
2031,20180070,This sweetness works because; like Johnson et al.; we in the audience know what shape rom-coms have historically taken; and are thus ready and able to have our expectations subverted in the purest of ways.
2032,20180070,The resultant plot follows a style reminiscent of the Shakespeare-inspired Ten Things I Hate About You and She's All That; making To All The Boys I've Loved an enjoyable trip down the comedy-of-deception genre.
2033,20180070,To All the Boys I've Loved Before is heartwarmingly sweet and features delightful performances.
2034,20180070,Lara Jean learns a lot of lessons--she changes and she grows--but she never becomes anything other than herself. It's always her discovering new sides of herself. That's so important for young women to see.
2035,20180070,A delightfully adorkable time.
2036,20180070,The film is precisely what it should be: pleasing and clever; comforting and fun and romantic.
2037,20180070,"Centineo is the big beating heart at the center of the somewhat reserved ""To All The Boys I've Loved Before."" He's a lot like his character; bringing out the best in this love story."
2038,20180070,Centineo performs a type of compassionate male energy that is in short supply in movies at the moment; but Lana Condor is undeniably TATBILB's star.
2039,20180070,Much of the movie's success is down to Condor's gentle appeal and her quiet chemistry with co-star Noah Centineo .
2040,20180070,Thrills in part because most viewers are all too familiar with what it feels like to baldly deny feelings for another person even as they become patently obvious to everyone else.
2041,20180071,Ryuichi Sakamoto's infectious curiosity about nature and the music of life; make for an engaging and moving subject. Highly recommended.
2042,20180071,There may not be enough conventional reference to the subject's life - marriages; children; and career - but that's because the film is unafraid to suggest that Sakamoto's music is his life.
2043,20180071,a moving and marvelous look at an artist and his inspirations through decades
2044,20180071,As we see vintage footage of the younger composer with jet-black hair; the artist's now-white hair and grizzled face make one wonder about the very purpose of decay...
2045,20180071,Ryuichi Sakamoto: Coda perfectly captures the somber side of the beloved composer but fails to better engage the other facets of his work and history.
2046,20180071,Spend some time with Riyuchi Sakamoto and you will see and hear the world differently. It's what some of us want in a movie experience.
2047,20180071,Schible started making his film in 2012; and Coda skips deftly across the years; incorporating intimate footage of the composer at work as well as archival footage from his earlier years.
2048,20180071,Won't hold much appeal for those requiring an introduction; but should please fans with its drifting; lyrical; and thoughtful tenor; echoing so much of this artist's music.
2049,20180071,"The intimate documentary ""Ryuichi Sakamoto: Coda"" finds the accomplished composer in a deeply introspective place in both his life and career."
2050,20180071,Simply by lingering with his pensive; compelling subject at the keyboard; or engaging Sakamoto (discreetly) in his thoughts on his life and his music; Schible casts a spell and captures the spirit of a uniquely gifted composer.
2051,20180071,Stephen Nomura Schible's documentary; Ryuichi Sakamoto: CODA is not only a portrait of a great artist; but a sensitive and engrossing depiction of the act of creation and its process.
2052,20180071,Isn't a life story or a deep-dive character study. Rather it is a heartfelt mediation on the creative process; with elegantly presented ideas on nature; music; mortality and things out of tune.
2053,20180072,A drama as steeped in gender politics as tense thrills underneath a western lens of gorgeously static wide-angles; a mesmerizing score; and brilliantly emotive performances.
2054,20180072,Marlina the Murderer in Four Acts is a brilliant female-driven arthouse/grindhouse rape-revenge Western that manages to endear; repulse; emotionally stir; mesmerize and propel in the best of ways.
2055,20180072,Not quite a Western or a revenge flick. Where those genres indulge in violence for a bit of schlocky fun; Marlina is a lot more ponderous; though it is hard to tell whether it takes itself seriously.
2056,20180072,Marlina the Murderer in Four Acts is simple at a glance; nuanced under scrutiny; and is a damn fine time at the movies.
2057,20180072,"""The film stands out in its treatment an active female protagonist not immediately supplanting male power; but slowly struggling to assume it."""
2058,20180072,"""Marlina"" is a film with very few faults; that manages to present a completely different take on the western; through an artful; meaningful and quite entertaining approach."
2059,20180072,With a Morricone-inspired score; gorgeous cinematography that screams to be witnessed on a big screen; and bleak humor; this film's tightly executed; meticulously controlled surface barely contains the seething fury within.
2060,20180072,A film of uneasy grandeur; at once offhand and gently mythic...
2061,20180072,"Working with the cinematographer Yunus Pasolang; Ms. Surya gives ""Marlina"" a stark; steady; captivating look that keeps you largely engaged even when the story and your attention drift."
2062,20180072,It's one of those features from a distant part of the globe that seems like it may have been created primarily for Western art houses and festivals; where its exemplary direction and feminist theme are indeed likely to win Surya new fans.
2063,20180072,Marlina the Murderer in Four Acts recalls the oaters of Sergio Leone and his brethren; all right; but it upends the usual male concerns for some serious and satisfying feminist payback.
2064,20180072,To its credit; the film eschews excess gore and mayhem; largely making its points in more subtly incisive ways.
2065,20180073,There is something almost pagan to the earth magic of Goldsworthy's work; through his eyes we reconnect with an elemental quality in the world around us that; somewhere along the line; we lost the ability to see.
2066,20180073,It's more naturalistic than its predecessor; feeling at times like a memoir or a reassessment by a man reaching the autumnal years of his career.
2067,20180073,Leaning into the Wind: Andy Goldsworthy>; treads much of the same ground [as the first]; but the environment and mankind's relationship to it has changed a lot since 2001.
2068,20180073,Goldsworthy's art is driven by an awareness of instability and mortality; which makes it a profound celebration of the present; of life.
2069,20180073,It is clear from watching Leaning Into the Wind that; for Goldsworthy; the labor; the action is as much a pleasure as the concept or the end result.
2070,20180073,The vulnerability on display is so raw and beautiful; you almost feel compelled to turn away.
2071,20180073,This is one of the most relaxing experiences I have had watching a movie in a long time.
2072,20180073,"""Leaning Into the Wind"" offers viewers a welcome chance to consider the work of an artist who defies the recent commodification cult to embrace the ephemeral and the nominally ""worthless."""
2073,20180073,There are moments where you may want to stop the film to assure yourself you're seeing what you're seeing; so disordering to the senses are Goldsworthy's re-orderings of nature.
2074,20180073,No matter how vivid your home setup might be; it's best to see this in a theatre.
2075,20180073,A friend who watched this with me said that it's the kind of film she'd like to see again when she's dying. That pretty much nails its meditative; melancholy tone...
2076,20180073,This is a hypnotic and beguiling documentary portrait of the 62-year-old site-specific land artist Andy Goldsworthy... Sit back; relax and; in the most literal way possible; watch an artist at work.
2077,20180074,In a tussle between the appeal of the subject and the plodding banality of the approach; the pups are ultimately the losers.
2078,20180074,A word of warning: it's American; at times; very so. But it's worth sticking with as the story becomes more complex.
2079,20180074,The story of a litter of five Labrador puppies; this warm-hearted gem of a film will cure what ails you; both in the moment and each time you think back to their journey into service and the trainers and adoptive families who make it possible.
2080,20180074,Where Guide Dogs for the Blind is concerned; many are called but only the premier litter picks are chosen.
2081,20180074,It's a beautiful thing to see.
2082,20180074,Guide dogs learn their trade in lovely docuseries.
2083,20180074,"""Pick of the Litter"" is made with heart and reverence for man's best friend; especially those special pooches who go on to answer a higher calling."
2084,20180074,This makes [Pick of the Litter] the perfect family film - especially if you're looking for an antidote to Marvel and DC.
2085,20180074,Viewers of all ages with a fondness for puppies will find it hard to resist.
2086,20180074,The dogs' personalities; highlighted by a handy name-tag graphic every time each one gets a segment; bound and yap off the screen.
2087,20180074,Yes; the structural constraints and the emotional rhythms of reality TV competition shows are all over this; but it's mostly irresistible.
2088,20180074,Though it could benefit from more context and history of guide dogs and a little less walk footage; the film offers compelling insight into a process most know little about-and whether they make the cut or not; there's a happy ending for every dog.
2089,20180075,There's enough of interest here to keep us engaged.
2090,20180075,Recommended. Does in seventy minutes what a History Channel docu couldn't do in seven hundred.
2091,20180075,There is something genuinely touching in observing how Louisianans have woven these creatures into their daily lives.
2092,20180075,Most of the people in Rodents of Unusual Size have had to learn how to deal with deal with the animals; and their creativity is astonishing.
2093,20180075,A fascinating metaphor for how humans see their relationship to the natural world.
2094,20180075,Directorial trio Quinn Costello; Chris Metzler and Jeff Springer... [have] made a little gem.
2095,20180075,A bit icky yet full of charm.
2096,20180075,The film's initial non-judgmental perspective eventually sounds more like a public service announcement...
2097,20180075,Rodents of Unusual Size is also a look at how human folly can contribute to environmental disaster; but awareness and ingenuity can help bail us out.
2098,20180075,The film demonstrates a surprising - and commendable - frankness; especially as its creators interview those working to stay afloat amid hurricanes and nutria-accelerated coastal erosion.
2099,20180075,Directors Quinn Costello; Chris Metzler; and Jeff Springer emphasize their subjects' creativity and camaraderie; resulting in a upbeat; flavorful community portrait.
2100,20180075,It's a fascinating look -- and it's only 70 minutes long.
2101,20180076,Thunder Road is a raw nerve of a film; empathetic and tender towards people who shouldn't be likeable.
2102,20180076,Jim Cummings; who wrote; directed and acted in the film deserves a pat on his back as he manages to channel out a very assured; matured and understated character sketch of a broken man on the verge of mental breakdown.
2103,20180076,The actor-director-writer [Jim Cummings] manages to make a host emotions radiate from him; making us participants of his pain and tragedy. [Full Review in Spanish]
2104,20180076,A sharp and original comedy. [Full Review in Spanish]
2105,20180076,While there is an expression of what happens in Bruce Springsteen's songs; on Thunder Road we don't find what it feels like to have lived them. [Full Review in Spanish]
2106,20180076,Thunder Road approaches serious; profound and even dangerous themes with comic elegance. [Full review in Spanish]
2107,20180076,Cummings presents us with a guy whose heart is in the right place - he just can't control himself.
2108,20180076,Dramatically; Thunder Road is a little thin; but the plot's not the point: this is all about Cummings; who sparkles with charisma and confidence. It's an unabashed indulgence.
2109,20180076,An emotional tour de force.
2110,20180076,A performance showcase for star; writer; director; editor and composer Jim Cummings which leaves you in no doubt you'll be seeing more of him.
2111,20180076,Such an unapologetic crisis of masculinity will strike some as self-indulgent in times such as these. Yet Cummings is so committed to Arnaud's tragicomic trajectory... that you can't take your eyes off him.
2112,20180076,In the spirit of many great comedians; Jim Cummings has a knack for taking lines that shouldn't be funny and transforming them into accidental zingers.
2113,20180077,Though it may require some distance and a good pick-me-up afterwards; you will appreciate the way Lean on Pete subverts your expectations and feels authentic to the human experience.
2114,20180077,Lean on Pete is a five-year-old chestnut quarter horse with movie-star eyes that fit the bill since he moseys off with every scene he's in.
2115,20180077,It is a remarkable film that reflects the director's ability to extract so much from a rather small story. [Full Review in Spanish]
2116,20180077,Haigh excels at capturing day-to-day details which ensures the authenticity of his characters. And his trademark unsensationalistic approach strips away the dramatics to reveal something raw and real.
2117,20180077,Heartbreaking it is; but the story of Lean on Pete never fails to deliver truth; both moment by moment; and in its ultimate conclusion.
2118,20180077,To put it plainly; Lean on Pete is writer-director Andrew Haigh's best work.
2119,20180077,Throughout; Plummer is mesmerizing; his sunken eyes and gaunt face telling of the layers of hardships Charley is forced to endure.
2120,20180077,Lean on Pete can feel like Dickens; under a starry and menacing American sky.
2121,20180077,In the second half of the film; the improbabilities mount and sentimentality creeps in. This; though; is still powerful and poignant filmmaking.
2122,20180077,Plummer gives an excellent performance: watchful; sensitive; delicate and yet possessed of a survivor's impassive quality.
2123,20180077,Haigh's new film has the substance and emotional heft to be considered a masterpiece.
2124,20180077,This is a film that succeeds in holding all its elements in balance - and in doing so; arrives at a depth of feeling that isn't commonplace at all.
2125,20180078,This story of an 8-year-old 'witch' literally tethered into servitude is both political exposé and political satire; the sense of sorrow and anger is enhanced by director Rungano Nyoni's artist's appreciation of the absurdity at the root of tragedy.
2126,20180078,In the debut of newcomer and previously untrained 9-year-old Maggie Mulubwa; the actress carries a sorrow that reads both weary and bone deep. She is compelling to watch and impossible to ignore.
2127,20180078,For a first film; Ms. Nyoni not only shows intelligence in the way she addresses the topic; but also reinstates hope in the African cinema...
2128,20180078,Yes; the leashes that bind these women are imaginary. But they're tied to real-world suffering. ... This is not a fantasy.
2129,20180078,Maggie Mulubwa is near expressionless throughout and barely speaks; but this makes all the difference; her wide eyes doing all the talking for her.
2130,20180078,While there's novelty and promise to Nyoni's little-girl-trapped tale; it tumbles into incoherence too early to merit endorsement.
2131,20180078,Nyoni does an excellent job of keeping an absurd tone while losing none of the gravity of the situation.
2132,20180078,Nyoni is clearly confident in her vision and the story she wants to tell; and in her capable hands; the result is spellbinding.
2133,20180078,A remarkable; strange and politically potent first film.
2134,20180078,Nyoni; working in English and the local language of Nyanja; has an unforced way of dealing with themes like exploitation; oppression and superstition; showing how easy it can be for nonsense to pass itself off as sense.
2135,20180078,Nyoni presents one dazzling set piece after another.
2136,20180078,Even if writer-director Rungano Nyoni's film were a lesser achievement - less unsettlingly complicated; less bitterly funny; less bluntly sad - it would still have the witch truck; one of the great cinematic images of this or any other year.
2137,20180079,Western knows there is a hierarchy in remembered violence.
2138,20180079,Neumann does an impressive work here; embracing his first role with natural ease and assuming great part of the responsibility in making of the tale a grounded and sincere experience.
2139,20180079,Perhaps its most lingering and disquieting idea is that perhaps the western; with its mythical visions of cowboys taming a wild land; wasn't quite as noble and benign as once we imagined.
2140,20180079,The feeling of constant threat adds density to an atmosphere that rises as the true protagonist of the film. [Full Review in Spanish]
2141,20180079,The film manages to stick around more than I expected; and the memories I have of it are pleasant indeed.
2142,20180079,...a film that simmers rather than boils; but Grisebach conjures an atmosphere and intensity which seeps into every inch of the screen.
2143,20180079,While the film hums with potential conflict; Grisebach is too singular simply to dress an old genre in new clothes. Instead; she coolly holds back her camera and paces out the escalation of hostilities under a humid Balkan sun.
2144,20180079,One of the films of the year has arrived - maybe the best of the year - a work of unmatched subtlety; complexity and artistry.
2145,20180079,The point of the title is to invoke a parallel; conjure a certain tradition. But it's the aggression and naked tensions of the genre that Grisebach has her eye on.
2146,20180079,Meinhard becomes increasingly enigmatic - was he a soldier? Is he a liar? What does he really want? - and [Valeska] Grisebach; sometimes infuriatingly; offers us tantalising hints of a drama that never quite fully unfolds.
2147,20180079,A meandering but quietly absorbing tale of comradeship amid social tensions.
2148,20180079,"Like its title; ""Western"" is both startlingly direct and full of resonance and ambiguity."
2149,20180080,A songwriter making his major acting debut; Dickey captures the burly; vulnerable quality of Foley's lyrics and vocal delivery; creating a palpable sense that the songs were excavated from the darkest corners of his soul.
2150,20180080,An affectionate; honest portrait that interrogates our need to deify dead icons; while carving out a space in music history long left vacant for Foley to fill.
2151,20180080,It's a lengthy; inebriating; and casually funny experience that didn't fall into the usual traps of biographical films.
2152,20180080,Hawke pieces together an impressive and thought-provoking tribute with a Texas-sized heart and the kind of performances that awards are made for. Even when you know what's coming; Blaze haunts you like a classic country song.
2153,20180080,What is surprising - and exciting - is the sensitivity with which Hawke has approached this difficult character. [Full review in Spanish]
2154,20180080,More than a biography about a cursed aura composer and performer; Blaze is a love song to the country & western. [Full Review in Spanish]
2155,20180080,Hawke's fascinated by the tug of war between artistic freedom and domestic responsibility; and he's found clever ways to deal with that theme while zigzagging through Foley's life of music; alcohol; cocaine and women.
2156,20180080,Hawke tells Foley's story with heart and style; and that's going to make Blaze Foley even more of a legend; and deservedly so.
2157,20180080,Hawke argues movingly that creative success has nothing to do with fame and everything to do with how an artist grows as a person and impacts the people around him.
2158,20180080,Dickey would have made a strong impression regardless. But it turns out he can act; and sing; and has a genuine magnetism that combines with an endearing quality to create a highly appealing screen presence.
2159,20180080,Hawke is more fascinated with passion than profile. And here; that's more than enough.
2160,20180080,Dickey looks like a big; shaggy dog with a wounded paw who's been left out in the rain overnight. And he's a real revelation.
2161,20180081,Charlize Theron gives such a commanding; blistering; and raw performance.
2162,20180081,Similar to her work in Juno; [Diablo Cody] offers a brutally honest tale about the struggles of motherhood rather than hide behind the illusion of a perfect family life.
2163,20180081,You don't have to be a parent to enjoy Tully. We've all been a parent or a child -- and this film is really about how we take care of ourselves; and each other.
2164,20180081,Tully brings to unvarnished life that being a mom isn't always magical.
2165,20180081,There's so much to learn and value in seeing the film; I appreciated the fact that a troubled mom did seek help; I'm just not sure the script needed the plot twist.
2166,20180081,Tully is all about the problems of excessive expectations of perfection thrust upon women in general and mothers in particular. Once you watch it; you're going to want to do something nice for your mom.
2167,20180081,Tully fails on every level except one: Charlize Theron wakes it from its lethargy; takes it by the jugular; and squeezes until it yells.
2168,20180081,"For those with an appetite for an early-summer movie with heart; but no costumes; ""Tully"" will take care of them; too."
2169,20180081,It's a slight story enlarged to universal dimensions by the sharpness of Cody's dialogue and the acuteness of her insights into the domestic pile-up that constitutes Marlo's day.
2170,20180081,The emotions Tully surfaces aren't comforting; and they have less to do with the actual realities of motherhood than with the idea of motherhood as something that leaves you forever changed and cut off from your younger self.
2171,20180081,As a portrayal of postpartum depression; Tully is a success-simplistic at times; but an admirable gut-punch nonetheless.
2172,20180081,This stylistic maturity is typical of writers; who tend to improve.
2173,20180082,Private Life is an existential rollercoaster; and only barely about a baby. (It's more like Waiting for Godot!)
2174,20180082,The time and effort Jenkins puts into her projects shows in every detail. Besides having three perfect performances; Jenkins' direction of fertility drama Private Life looks effortlessly perfect. [TOP 50 FILMS OF THE DECADE]
2175,20180082,A wry; very humanistic drama that's full of the laughter of life; embodied by a wonderful ensemble who intersect across different stages of New York life in unexpected ways.
2176,20180082,Paul Giamatti and Kathryn Hahn break out all the acting stops to play a hipster Lower East Side couple who put off getting pregnant until it's too late.
2177,20180082,With the masterful Private Life; Tamara Jenkins excavates without puncture; but small cuts can cause the most acute pain.
2178,20180082,Jenkins' writing and directing feels more fruitful when it veers more toward the dramatic and avoids the contrived; screwball machinations.
2179,20180082,The film gets a lot of mileage out of the quotidian parts of New York City life; from the Wild Nova at Russ and Daughters to opposite side of the street parking.
2180,20180082,Scenes of painful turmoil play like skillful script readings rather than life events.
2181,20180082,Perhaps most importantly; it's a reminder that Tamara Jenkins is a vital voice in a landscape that's become increasingly; painfully unfriendly to what she does best.
2182,20180082,Jenkins has produced a small gem - an unassuming and surprisingly profound motion picture that touches on primal motivations and instincts.
2183,20180082,This lived-in and often-hilarious drama is a richly rewarding experience -and features a whopper of a closing shot.
2184,20180082,Private Life [is] such an affecting-and ultimately devastating-work.
2185,20180083,Few voices are missing from this incredibly thorough piece of work. Zierra has rounded up dozens of cast and crew members with stories to tell; and though the film is densely packed with information; nothing feels extraneous.
2186,20180083,Candid and unsentimental; Filmworker is bound to leave an impression on the minds of any cinephile.
2187,20180083,There is something genuinely touching about Kubrick's blind faith in Vitali.
2188,20180083,After a while; the anecdotes amount to Kubrick stanning.
2189,20180083,Twenty feet from stardom; a million miles from sanity
2190,20180083,Filmworker works best when poking holes in the altar of genius men whose attention to detail is almost always inexplicably tethered to being an outright bastard.
2191,20180083,Tony Zierra's fond and slightly unsettling film is; among other things; a reminder of the egolessness necessary for great egos to flourish.
2192,20180083,Next time you watch a Kubruck movie; take note of the high-contrast black and white; or of how consistent the colors have remained over the decades. Thanks; Mr. Vitale!
2193,20180083,Whether you're fascinated by Kubrick or the human condition this is a minor classic.
2194,20180083,"""Filmworker's"" greatest value lies in pulling the lens back to allow viewers to understand film as a deeply collaborative medium; one in which even the most venerated auteurs cannot accomplish their greatest feats alone."
2195,20180083,"""Filmworker"" is a first-rate account of the ongoing creative process some call dysfunctional. Well; anyone would call it that; actually. But some would also call it worth it."
2196,20180083,There's plenty of production detail for Kubrick nuts; though the two competing narratives (Kubrick the genius; Kubrick the tyrant) won't surprise anyone.
2197,20180084,Buckley's performance at least helps maintain attention; but all else is essentially a wash.
2198,20180084,The powerful performances of Buckley and Flynn keep us engrossed in this tale as it unfolds; although the ending is a bit of a let- down.
2199,20180084,Beast has some good performances and an interesting story; but there just isn't enough there to justify an entire movie.
2200,20180084,Buckley gets under the skin of her character as Moll finds herself caught between two worlds.
2201,20180084,"All is manifestly not well on the manicured island of Jersey where tour-coach hostess Moll lives at home with her domineering; ""best-friend"" mother and her Alzheimer's-afflicted father."
2202,20180084,Beast offers such a striking cast of characters; and such an involving; twisting narrative; that it will have you on tenterhooks well before the intense; pitch-perfect climax.
2203,20180084,"""Beast"" is a pitch black ride into the recesses of the human soul; and Buckley is the film's cold; dark heart."
2204,20180084,Not since Sissy Spacek fell in with Martin Sheen in Badlands has an actress taken us through the process of swapping home and hearth for a homicidal maniac with the manic intensity Buckley displays here.
2205,20180084,[Jessie Buckley's] increasingly unhinged performance is reason enough to see the film; as is the assured direction of newcomer Michael Pearce; even if his skills as a writer are less obvious.
2206,20180084,A jagged but memorable feature... that slowly yields its truths.
2207,20180084,This is a film of some power; and one that doesn't flinch from following its more disturbing implications through to the end.
2208,20180084,The leads deliver affecting; nuanced performances; which gives heft to the psychological insights.
2209,20180085,Just as I remember.
2210,20180085,In his account of good Kentucky boys gone inexplicably rogue; documentarian Bart Layton puts his reality-bitten experience to good use; cutting between the actual men the boys became and an ensemble of actors playing them as their misguided 2004 selves.
2211,20180085,American Animals is entertaining while answering the question most people have thought about at one time or another...If I tried to commit a crime; could I get away with it?
2212,20180085,Life imitating art is a real dynamic for these boys; as it is for the film itself (which opts for actors and thrilling heist tropes rather than a straightforward documentary).
2213,20180085,[T]hanks to first-person accounts of the real-life robbers; not to mention Layton's highly tense direction; the ambiguity of the whole piece leaves you wanting to go over it again and again.
2214,20180085,Shifting the docudrama balance to the latter half of the portmanteau; AMERICAN ANIMALS is well paced and inventive with the truth in a way that grips rather than grates.
2215,20180085,This is a film that takes deep pleasure in itself. Much of the time; you will be pleased with it too.
2216,20180085,It's really the style and performances; more than the pseudo-experimental structure Layton has chosen; that keep the film grabby.
2217,20180085,The movie reaches strange and savage heights...not just because it seems to be engaging with huge philosophical questions about the nature of identity in the modern world. It's more focused than that; because the context is specifically American.
2218,20180085,Other directors have folded real-world figures into fictional narratives. It's the scale of the invasion that sets Layton's project apart.
2219,20180085,At times; the film seems as hardboiled as the heist thrillers that Warren and Spencer study on DVD but the director never loses sight of the absurdity of the plan or of the bungling amateurism of the perpetrators.
2220,20180085,It's a clever movie; but not too clever. It's also thoughtful and engrossing; weird as hell. And it's true - or truer than most films that claim that label.
2221,20180086,"As a huge supporters of not just women's rights; but ""human rights; On Her Shoulders is a film that will strike a chord for everyone and encourage one to take action and no longer sit on the sidelines."
2222,20180086,A good documentary about Nadia Murad.
2223,20180086,s a filmmaker; [Alexandria] Bombach (Frame by Frame) treats her with respect; but stops short of full-fledged worship.
2224,20180086,The film takes an intimate approach to its subject; who occasionally speaks directly to the camera. These moments can be revelatory.
2225,20180086,lexandria Bombach won a directing prize at Sundance for this portrait of Murad; but On Her Shoulders might just as well have been made by Murad's publicist.
2226,20180086,Bombach's film; and Nadia's willingness to participate in it; reminds us that what happens a world away is happening to us; to all of us as humankind.
2227,20180086,Its subject compels throughout.
2228,20180086,"""On Her Shoulders"" is a moving; sensitive portrayal of a woman - and a people's - perseverance."
2229,20180086,On Her Shoulders is close to being awful.
2230,20180086,Nadia is shown always surrounded by crowds; almost crushed by them. But her utter loneliness is heartbreaking.
2231,20180086,Be ready for tears; on screen and your own.
2232,20180086,Director Alexandria Bombach (Frame by Frame) shot this documentary portrait of human rights activist Nadia Murad not long before her subject received the Nobel Peace Prize; and the movie argues persuasively that the prize was well deserved.
2233,20180087,Reed does a masterful job pulling this all together; letting the people in Montana speak; and allowing the audience to draw their own conclusions about the national problem.
2234,20180087,Using the serene beauty of the Montana mountains as a backdrop for the pulsing thriller; Adams acts as the film's heartbeat...
2235,20180087,Director Kimberly Reed smartly grabs our attention by using the gorgeous and thinly populated state of Montana as a microcosm for the ongoing corruption of the election process.
2236,20180087,However; where Dark Money succeeds is where so many other political docs fail: it offers a buffet of solutions to the problem at heart; and all seem feasible enough to inspire action from even the most skeptical political cynics.
2237,20180087,This Sundance-heralded doc is at times a lot of fun; but it never lets us forget that the joke could be on us.
2238,20180087,Director Kimberly Reed has made one of the most important films in years.
2239,20180087,Damning; clear-eyed; and as gripping as any John Grisham thriller.
2240,20180087,Engrossing; lucid; and unsettling...
2241,20180087,Activist in tone; and paced like a thriller; Reed's movie painstakingly details how an election can be brusquely seized and swayed by unseen forces.
2242,20180087,"""Dark Money"" takes a detailed look at an unexpectedly complex situation that is at the heart of political action today."
2243,20180087,The undue influence of money on elections is not exactly news; but the ways in which that influence can now be secured; given the current state of the law; certainly is.
2244,20180087,"""Dark Money"" exposes the dangers of unbridled; anonymous political spending so expertly that it will make you fume with anger; practically quake with distress."
2245,20180088,The always excellent Regina Hall stars as den mother to a group of waitresses in this low-key; slice-of-life comedy.
2246,20180088,Admittedly; I didn't understand Support the Girls for much of the running time. It feels like scene after scene of nothing happening. However; the remarkable final 20 minutes pull the entire movie together.
2247,20180088,Support the Girls is a smart; intelligent and ultimately bittersweet slice-of-life celebrating solidarity and empowerment in spaces where women are often discouraged from having either.
2248,20180088,Overall; Support the Girls subtly celebrates sisterhood in the most unexpected place; with Regina Hall leading a diverse cast that delivers sass and charm.
2249,20180088,This is also another excellent example of Regina Hall just being brilliant. The more films I see with her in; the better.
2250,20180088,Leaving the cinema after Support the Girls; I felt different. I looked at the people around me differently; with a keener sense of empathy. The world felt somehow warmer. [TOP 50 FILMS OF THE DECADE]
2251,20180088,A neorealist take on our capitalist times; reaffirming the essential need for camaraderie every day of the working week.
2252,20180088,Support the Girls is a shrewdly observed; day-in-the-life-style portrait of a woman under pressure.
2253,20180088,Hall is a revelation (dominant in nearly every scene); and the rooftop climax is fittingly cathartic.
2254,20180088,Bujalski uses the past to make sense of the present... and the future.
2255,20180088,A remarkably compassionate portrait of American womanhood that inspires hope without denying reality.
2256,20180088,The story meanders near the end; but the anticlimax can't quite dispel the movie's warm eccentricity.
2257,20180089,A quiet; heartbreaking film that never overdoes the melodramatic trappings of its story.
2258,20180089,Tan stresses the tragic dimension of the story; but also its ordinariness. It's a tale of a boy and his family that could be played out in any American town; in 1985 or today.
2259,20180089,...marked by beautiful black and white cinematography; quietly moving performances and a sustained mood of tenderness and terrible pain.
2260,20180089,Assuming you can go home again; the visit might not be the smoothest ride of your life. That sad concept resonates through Yen Tan's drama; set in the nightmare onset of AIDS.
2261,20180089,Yen Tan embraces the quiet; and embraces the domesticity of central-American life; celebrating what makes an American family something worth aspiring for; while equally exploring the troubles that are inherent with that life.
2262,20180089,[Cory Michael Smith's] performance supports the entire film. [Full review in Spanish]
2263,20180089,1985 feels like a missing minor classic from the decade that preceded the rise of the so-called New Queer Cinema.
2264,20180089,It's a beautifully acted film. In the dark days of the epidemic it would surely have been impossible to make a drama so balanced; so compassionately attuned to everyone's feelings.
2265,20180089,"Writer-director Yen Tan; expanding a same-subject short film; takes his tale slowly; letting the drama breathe and the cast essay ""being"" rather than ""acting""."
2266,20180089,A poignant footnote to a monumental crisis.
2267,20180089,The dark inky frames are full of shadows and dread. Yet the narrative; and Adrian's journey; is always leavened with quiet compassion.
2268,20180089,What really distinguishes the film is that it gets deep inside this broken family without becoming histrionic or accusatory. Tan avoids any hint of sentimentality; concentrating on the pain instead.
2269,20180090,A wonderful look at the complex; fragile father-daughter relationship; and the binding thread that is music.
2270,20180090,A lovely warm hug that features tender performances and sweet songs.
2271,20180090,I honestly found it kind of boring...
2272,20180090,(Written by Greg Wetherall) A solid; well-intentioned thrum on the heartstrings; given warm overtones by some fine performances.
2273,20180090,Hearts Beat Loud; despite being somehow a conventional dramedy; is novel in its approach of the subject depicting a blossoming romance between two millennial; queer; women of color.
2274,20180090,A sweet; heartwarming drama.
2275,20180090,A keenly observed story of a Brooklyn father and daughter; charged with the kind of music as free-spirited as the duo is.
2276,20180090,Dramatic tension may be in short supply but Hearts Beat Loud makes very pleasurable viewing precisely because it is so mellow and its very genial protagonists are so self-effacing.
2277,20180090,[Offerman and Clemons] and director/co-writer Brett Haley keep the story percolating - just.
2278,20180090,A slice of pure cinematic joy with Offerman and Clemons on top form.
2279,20180090,Offerman puts in a subtle turn beneath his humongous ageing-hipster beard and Clemons is deliciously natural as the exasperated Sam.
2280,20180090,Offerman holds it all together with a performance as powerful as it is quiet.
2281,20180091,What makes [Coralie] Fargeat's tale rather unique is its female perspective.
2282,20180091,Revenge rolls out a blood-soaked red carpet that Coralie Fargeat walks with breakout regard.
2283,20180091,This is not feminism; it's exploitation disguised as feminism.
2284,20180091,It more than satisfies and exceeds expectations and hopefully will serve as a turning point for the genre.
2285,20180091,It knows its niche perfectly. It fills that niche precisely.
2286,20180091,The emotional and mental effect on the characters and the viewer is what hits the hardest and not the obvious violence that unfolds through to the end.
2287,20180091,Revenge is a bloody middle finger ... a kick in the balls with a feminine combat boot. You've been warned; gents.
2288,20180091,"Gore-soaked and transgressive; ""Revenge"" will test your stomach's mettle - in a variety of ways."
2289,20180091,If you usually find the genre icky and exploitative; try this one-but only if you've got the stomach for an abattoir's worth of blood in a single movie.
2290,20180091,Revenge won't be an experience every viewer can handle; but as a piece of extreme horror; it's an intelligent and flashy debut.
2291,20180091,What happens next is expected-a roaring rampage of revenge; with each of the three hunters confronted like a video game boss-but Fargeat has some fun tricks to deploy.
2292,20180091,With her stylish and bloody rape-revenge thriller; French first-timer Coralie Fargeat turns a disputable subgenre upside down.
2293,20180092,The story works as an allegory for how people get stuck in and then; if they're lucky; escape the repetitive; often abusive cycles in their lives.
2294,20180092,A bold attempt to tell a familiar tale in a new way; however a loose hold on tone and execution mar what could have been a cult favourite.
2295,20180092,"The Endless ends up going more ""Twilight Zone"" than Heaven's Gate."
2296,20180092,The Endless delves into this unknown and seemingly unexplainable phenomenon and successfully allows the audience to wrap their head around something repetitiously terrifying.
2297,20180092,Moorhead and Benson's plot gets bogged down in overly mannered explanations.
2298,20180092,The Endless is a film that takes its time to get to the point; but makes sense the more it advances while also adding layers to its story.
2299,20180092,This is Benson and Moorhead's most professionally-made movie to date; but they hold on to an amateurish enthusiasm that works largely for the best.
2300,20180092,This impressive low-budget indie weaves a genre-defying tapestry of weirdness; atmospherics and cultish horrors across a dusty US setting.
2301,20180092,There is a very good idea for a really intriguing; startling film here; that finally gets a little lost in its own freakily cosmic claustrophobia.
2302,20180092,Bewitching.
2303,20180092,It's slightly baffling at times; but always inventive and disquieting.
2304,20180092,Unfortunately the filmmakers introduce a sci-fi element in the second half that deflates much of the interpersonal tension and shifts the focus from the subtleties of mind control to the vagaries of time and space.
2305,20180093,Creed II is like the best parts of Rocky II-V hot glued together.
2306,20180093,I almost found myself rooting for Viktor Drago to win the final fight; not because of any anti-American sentiment; but because it's always fun to see the actual underdog win.
2307,20180093,Overall; Michael B. Jordan knocks it out of the park (or the ring?) again; providing a strong emotional backbone to the movie.
2308,20180093,Stallone has never been one to phone it in; and his script; as silly as it can be; is vintage Rocky. The performances are fantastic as well.
2309,20180093,Scripted by Stallone and Juel Taylor; Creed II deserves a cheer.
2310,20180093,reed 2 film doesn't reach the dizzying heights of the original but is still a quasi-satisfying chapter in the Rocky franchise.
2311,20180093,It's a sturdy second round after a cracking first one.
2312,20180093,As the eighth instalment in an ancient boxing franchise; Creed II should not be this good. Yet at times it is flat-out thrilling.
2313,20180093,Ryan Coogler; having gone on to bigger and bigger things; steps aside and lets relative newcomer Steven Caple; Jr. do the job of mixing the beats of Rocky III and Rocky IV into a smooth groove for the son of Apollo Creed (Michael B. Jordan).
2314,20180093,Creed II is almost a match for its predecessor in most respects; and in one its superior.
2315,20180093,Creed II fits the mold of every Rocky sequel-competent; entertaining; and a little passionless
2316,20180093,Battle fatigue sets in roughly halfway through this eighth installment of Sylvester Stallone's Rocky franchise.
2317,20180094,"Zain; estimated age 12 and serving five years' jail time ""because I stabbed a sonofabitch;"" is suing his neglectful parents for giving birth to him."
2318,20180094,Those expecting misery can rest assured that they will see plenty of it; but director Nadine Labaki manages to also put in moments of beauty and even hope.
2319,20180094,No doubt it is a tongue-in-cheek name; but it is true that Capharnaüm is about many things: corruption and racism; refugees; stolen childhood; the moral weakness of adults and the difficulty in apportioning blame.
2320,20180094,A tough-to-watch neorealist drama from Nadine Labaki; Capharnaüm (or Chaos) captures the nascent fury of twelve-year-old Zain (a brave performance by Zain Al Rafeea); a Beirut slumdweller suing his parents for giving birth to him
2321,20180094,There are moments of humor but mostly there is an aching sense of social collapse and chaos; where humans are simply chattel and their lives are cheap.
2322,20180094,It really all hinges on the performance; but the way Nadine Labaki has shot certain segments really adds to it...
2323,20180094,[Director Nadine] Labaki elicits an astonishing performance from her young lead.
2324,20180094,"Co-writer and director Nadine Labaki shoots ""Capernaum"" with a fluent; documentary-like realism."
2325,20180094,It's harsh and abrasive; and sometimes difficult...but Labaki has layered the film with just enough moments of kindness to break your heart.
2326,20180094,Jail and courtroom scenes; at the beginning and end; may be a tad implausible; not to mention scrappy. But the middle section; mostly shot on handheld cameras on the streets of Beirut; is breathtaking; topical; hilarious; tender and brutal.
2327,20180094,It's essential viewing for the ways in which it illuminates brutally hard lives many of us could otherwise not imagine; and for the craft of its nonprofessional performers.
2328,20180094,It's a very harrowing portrait... Zain Al Rafeea is amazing.
2329,20180095,As a collective conceptual art project; Bisbee '17 is stirring in its ambition and cathartic in its results.
2330,20180095,When a film takes a moment in history previously unknown to most and turns it into a riveting; compelling film that breaks all bounds of what we think we know about documentaries; you've got a winner on your hands.
2331,20180095,Just whose America is this?
2332,20180095,A fierce and timely work; haunted by the sins of America's past that echo the atrocities of its present.
2333,20180095,Greene introduces his premise as though a game and then lets the camera capture personal truths his amateur actors learn in the process.
2334,20180095,Divisions; collaboration; dreams; nightmares; paranoia; land; facades; and capital have always been key cogs in the darkness of the American experiment; and Bisbee '17 won't let you forget that.
2335,20180095,Greene's movie... grows into an adventurous exercise in drama-documentary; what could have seemed arch or awkward is handled with grace and tact; and there is even a song.
2336,20180095,"In some respects ""Bisbee '17"" serves as a kind of therapy for the town. But it's still difficult material."
2337,20180095,Greene has made a hard movie to argue with; even as he invites you to do exactly that.
2338,20180095,An interesting if unfulfilling documentary experiment...
2339,20180095,It would be enough for any documentary to tell this piece of hushed-up history; but Bisbee '17 is onto something more radical; watching it is like witnessing the defusing of a time bomb from a foot away.
2340,20180095,A fascinating exercise in nonfiction filmmaking as a performative; interdisciplinary; collective act; as well as a provocative inquiry into how selective memory; ideology; shame and unspeakable trauma shape what we come to accept as official history.
2341,20180096,Set in a quiet corner of France; The Guardians is a study of women; often mothers; daughters; and sisters; on the home front during World War I as they combat the everyday and the uncertainty often brought with conflict.
2342,20180096,The Guardians is an icy tale of injustice; war; love; despair; and adaptability; which unfolds serenely yet assuredly with attentive period detail.
2343,20180096,"Not surprisingly; and almost happily; the closing song; ""Love is Fragile""; ideally sums up the proceedings with the sage advice that ""Happiness is a vain dream;""..."
2344,20180096,The rich and wondrous tapestry of rural life is brought to the screen in glorious hues.
2345,20180096,The consequences of the war. Woman as a leaders of the society. About feminist when people does not know its meaning. A masterpiece. [Full review in Spanish]
2346,20180096,Beauvois demonstrates how the Great War not only changed people's relationships with each other; but how it altered the core of their relationship to their native land.
2347,20180096,From its slow-burning beginning; The Guardians develops into an epic melodrama. It's a wartime story in which; for a change; the men are relegated to supporting roles.
2348,20180096,The beauty and the pathos of the film are vivid in every frame.
2349,20180096,Beauvois's vision of the period is totally convincing; and his depiction of hardscrabble farm life rings with a quiet vibrancy...
2350,20180096,Like an 18th-century novel; it's fascinating; incredibly detailed and a bit too long.
2351,20180096,A pleasing Sunday-afternoon wallow - but not a transcendent one.
2352,20180096,A story of women waiting for their soldiers to return; this unfolds in fairly predictable fashion; though the film's solemnity is seductive.
2353,20180097,The script has a lot to say about the fear of being alone; the act of voyeurism; and the loss of identity; but it also works as a twisty mind-bender of a thriller -- thanks in large part to the stellar performance(s) by Madeline Brewer.
2354,20180097,All in all; I found CAM to be a tightly wound thriller that kept me guessing throughout its entire runtime.
2355,20180097,The movie's nightmarish quest for Alice to assert and establish her true identity is the stuff of all our darknesses; but the digital design and the focus on alluring sex workers gives it an odd; unique spin.
2356,20180097,Cam never figures out how to be both sexploitation and something else entirely.
2357,20180097,There's ripe artistic possibility in exploring the interplay between projection and identity within these spaces... The new horror film Cam understands this potential; and wrings both scares and some visual ingenuity out of it.
2358,20180097,The openness of what is happening is something that makes the film and its ending much more interesting than if it has been what one may think it is at first. There is more than meets the eye here and it will make some want to watch Cam more than once.
2359,20180097,Cam is a suspenseful mind-bender with plenty of timely feminist subtext.
2360,20180097,[A] remarkably accomplished thriller...
2361,20180097,"An at-times too-elusive but overall engaging peek behind the curtain at the lives of ""cam girls."""
2362,20180097,"""Cam"" is more successful as an oddly feminist tale of gutsy self-reliance than as a fully developed drama."
2363,20180097,As a metaphor it's disquieting; but the telling - with its Cronenberg-like screens; nightmarish brightness; and probing cinematography - makes it throb with uneasy energy.
2364,20180097,Horror; at its best; reconstructs the formula of the genre and reflects what frightens us in a particular moment. Simply put; Cam is about the terror of getting locked out of your online accounts and losing your manufactured identity.
2365,20180098,A work that acutely grasps the emotional dissonance borne of family ties.
2366,20180098,Beautiful coming-of-age drama is slightly undermined by its own artistic tendencies.
2367,20180098,Rarely does a first film reach the strength and emotional weight that [director Jeremiah] Zagar has achieved in this debut. [Full review in Spanish]
2368,20180098,Without a trace of luridness; We the Animals manages to be heartbreaking and harrowing. What saves it from being depressing is the exhilaration of Zagar's direction; and the unbridled energy and unstudied authenticity of the cast.
2369,20180098,...a beautifully realised film that owes a great debt to a number of cinematic forebears. Although this may prevent it from becoming a cultural touchstone for others; it is nevertheless a rhythmic story that sweeps you into its coming-of-age tale.
2370,20180098,Director Jeremiah Zagar (with co-screenwriter Daniel Kitrosser) creates a child's vision of a world filled with beauty and sheer terror.
2371,20180098,One of the best of the year so far.
2372,20180098,Zagar builds a world that is simultaneously deeply authentic and dreamlike - the perfect combination to express a child's deeply felt but inherently distorted view of the universe he inhabits.
2373,20180098,The conclusion is certain enough to be practically foregone; and if what leads up to it is aggressively arty; it's also artful and frank; a rare combination.
2374,20180098,This movie is so gorgeous; it even makes drone footage look ethereal rather than pedestrian.
2375,20180098,It is a thing of beauty: too beautiful perhaps; running a real danger of prettifying poverty.
2376,20180098,While the child actors are often excellent; they don't get much to say; and it's asking a lot for boys of primary-school age to express soulful depths through glances alone.
2377,20180099,One of the best superhero movies... [Full Review in Spanish]
2378,20180099,Teen Titans GO! To The Movies is a welcome respite from The House of Mouse's utter dominance.
2379,20180099,Unquestionably one of the best animated superhero films ever to grace the big screen; Teen Titans Go! To the Movies should be essential viewing for cinemagoers of all ages.
2380,20180099,This movie is a ton of fun and a great movie to see this summer; especially for kids definitely take some time out and go see this on the big screen.
2381,20180099,A palate-cleansing movie; and it's great; much needed...I'm glad I watched it.
2382,20180099,One of those movies where it's hard to even break down. See it and enjoy it for what it is. I don't see anyone not having a good time with this one.
2383,20180099,While the kids at the screening I attended laughed hysterically at the fart jokes; the parents chuckled at the slightly more sophisticated humour and the adult geeks howled at the deeper pop cultural references.
2384,20180099,Most of the gags in this pandering spoof are about their own schematic nature - they're jokes about how you're smarter than the jokes.
2385,20180099,Spun off from a Cartoon Network TV series; this is a self-reflexive exercise.
2386,20180099,Teen Titans Go! To The Movies may be unflaggingly daft; but outright silliness is rarely this smart.
2387,20180099,It's encouraging to see someone at DC approaching this material as an opportunity for colourful fun rather than a grim matter of rights maintenance.
2388,20180099,The Hollywood Teen Titans Go! initially looks more progressive than its real-life counterpart - but the climax gives this a rather different spin.
2389,20180100,A mishmash of fairy tale; horror film; and social commentary; Good Manners is almost like three entirely different movies. It all adds up to a uniquely intriguing film ...
2390,20180100,Good Manners artfully explores unconventional relationships; unconventional motherhood; and the bonds we make with those whom we love.
2391,20180100,The emotional core is what makes Good Manners (As Boas Maneiras) both gripping and unforgettable. The filmmakers expertly blend jagged humour with wrenching horror; keeping the audience laughing and gasping from start to finish.
2392,20180100,Good Manners is a romance; a coming-of-age story; a monster movie; and even a bit of a musical. So; it's surprising; with so many disparate elements; that the story holds together.
2393,20180100,Good Manners is a modern fairytale of such astounding beauty; charm and heart.
2394,20180100,Eerie and shot with a lurid formalism that makes it all the scarier (São Paulo's nights have looked more frightening); Good Manners delivers on its chills and thrills.
2395,20180100,There are moments to treasure throughout; from lovely out-of-nowhere musical numbers to the beautiful hand-drawn stills that depict a key flashback.
2396,20180100,A heady blend of heightened reality and grounded fantasy...
2397,20180100,Swerving from predictable to confounding; dreamy to demented; artful to awkward; this genre-twisting hybrid from Juliana Rojas and Marco Dutra links art house and slaughterhouse with unexpected success.
2398,20180100,The tone grows increasingly delicate and sweet; in fact the film ends up feeling like a fairy tale.
2399,20180100,"""Good Manners"" is a haunting tale of love - and the burdens that come with it."
2400,20180100,The filmmakers have a grand habit of stealing from others and making it their own.
2401,20190001,A picture that audaciously devours the force of convention and transforms it into a feverish undercurrent; driving what can only be described as an engine through the odyssey of mayhem.
2402,20190001,...director Bong is also working on other levels; not only making all of its characters relatable - the Parks are really quite sweet people; if a little lacking in self-awareness - but telling his story with a healthy dose of uproarious slapstick.
2403,20190001,It's very rare a film makes a step-change in what is going on and the dynamics of the characters; and makes that work as well it does here.
2404,20190001,PARASITE is Bong Joon Ho's masterpiece.
2405,20190001,Settling in for a narrative about a family trying to keep it together by overpowering the capitalistic battle; Bong Joon-ho has constructed a low-key tragic comedy that insists on being more than just that.
2406,20190001,under the guise of an engaging; thrilling; rip-roaring piece of entertainment...; Bong has delivered a spectacular deconstruction of the late-capitalist society in which we all must live together - if not all on the same level.
2407,20190001,"Let's just say that by ""Parasite's"" conclusion; what started out as a comedy of manners has become a furious snarl of rage and his most arresting social satire yet."
2408,20190001,If the movie is a Rorschach of who you identify as parasite and host; it's a test you're just as likely to fail; a filmgoing experience that refuses to fit into any box; and forces viewers to breathe the dangerous air outside of it too.
2409,20190001,A film that always has two thoughts in its head at once; a spectacular epic and tightly wound chamber piece; chicly sophisticated; brutal as a hammer.
2410,20190001,An imaginative comedy-thriller with darkness at its core.
2411,20190001,Bong delivers a stunning return to form with this newest venture.
2412,20190001,[Bong Joon-ho]'s work is as playful as it is sincere and revelatory. He'll make you feel at home; and then rip the rug out from under you.
2413,20190002,podcast review
2414,20190002,As fun as the movie is; there's an undeniable hollowness at its core induced by its unwillingness to follow through on certain ideas and symbols.
2415,20190002,I wouldn't have believed the breezy and tongue-in-cheek Avengers Assemble would evolve into such an odiously self-important endeavour a mere seven years later.
2416,20190002,It was good.
2417,20190002,It was exactly what it needed to be and nothing more.
2418,20190002,All told; Endgame is a highly satisfying celebration of 10 years of the MCU; and a great bookend to the first three phases.
2419,20190002,Endgame consists almost entirely of the downtime scenes that were always secretly everyone's favorite parts of these movies anyway.
2420,20190002,"The MCU will go on and on; but this chapter - and the American pragmatism vs. American ideals bromance that drove it - have well and truly come to their ""Excelsior! Nuff said!"" moment."
2421,20190002,"What's missing from ""Endgame"" is the free play of imagination; the liberation of speculation; the meandering paths and loose ends that start in logic and lead to wonder."
2422,20190002,The only complaint about Avengers: Endgame is that it raises the bar so high that there may well never be a superhero movie to match it.
2423,20190002,What you will be getting when you walk into an inevitably overstuffed movie theater is something singular that reflects our age in a way that none of the MCU films that preceded it have-indeed; very few Hollywood spectacles ever have.
2424,20190002,This is a feat of engineering... I felt a sense of catharsis finishing it.
2425,20190003,Us is packed with excellent imagery and is easily one of the best horror films of 2019. It also disappoints by explaining its scariest material away.
2426,20190003,Simultaneously terrifying and hilarious; Us is a popcorn movie with the depth and gravity of Kubrick and the hair-raising suspense of peak Hitchcock.
2427,20190003,Peele crafted a film that successfully follows up his last Oscar-winning hit with something very chilling but also completely different.
2428,20190003,US is a thrilling creation; a maniacal contraption; fiendishly clever and beautifully constructed.
2429,20190003,This is a sprawling; messy film that finds real darkness in the spaces between what it says and what it shows
2430,20190003,Jordan Peele handily proves that he's one of the leading voices in horror cinema.
2431,20190003,Us revolves around an allegory that's more elastic and resistant to parsing than megahit Get Out.
2432,20190003,A sharp; often funny meditation on the terrifying power of human connection.
2433,20190003,I love the performances; but I'm just not super sold on the script; to be honest... I'm really ready for [Jordan Peele] to be his own voice now.
2434,20190003,Every element in this film serves a purpose and is set up like a chess move; from the soundtrack to the detailed production values. (Be sure to check out the old VHS tapes in a flashback sequence).
2435,20190003,Peele develops a genuinely thrilling; heart-in-the-throat-scary horror picture.
2436,20190003,It's one thing for a movie to humble you by leaving you unsure about yourself and your place in the world; it's another for it to leave you wondering what; exactly; a filmmaker is trying to use his formidable verbal and visual vocabulary to say.
2437,20190004,It looked great; on top of the fact that the story was so interesting; and kept you glued to your seat...
2438,20190004,I love a good murder-mystery thats well-acted and well-paced. Daniel Craig was amazing.
2439,20190004,"A hilarious ""who done it"" that will make you laugh; second guess everything; and become truly invested in the results of the investigation."
2440,20190004,Knives Out is a deliciously twisty mystery that has no right to be as funny as it is.
2441,20190004,With a perfectly calibrated tone that goes over the top and enjoys every minute; this witty; twisty comedy was vibrant yet macabre and; most importantly; totally engrossing.
2442,20190004,The story; in which Johnson wrote the screenplay himself; combines a reasonably solid mix of black comedy and classic whodunit tale.
2443,20190004,Knives Out is a whole lot of fun; intended to keep the audience off-balance right up until the finish. It's a razor-sharp throwback from writer-director Rian Johnson.
2444,20190004,I suspect that Johnson; an adolescent genre enthusiast to his core; has waited since age 10 to make a movie like this. His enjoyment is contagious; even for those of us who don't think Knives Out quite hits its marks.
2445,20190004,An entertainment that's as smart; witty; stylish and exhilarating as any movie lover could wish for.
2446,20190004,There's a great deal of lively and funny shenanigans with poisons and antidotes; and Johnson delivers a stab of cheerful cynicism.
2447,20190004,Knives Out deserves to be explored as a world of it own; as Johnson balances moral conscience and black humor expertly within the constraints of the murder-mystery genre.
2448,20190004,"""Knives Out;"" in the end; believes earnestly in the whodunit; it just wants to turn it inside out. To say more about that would spoil the fun. But keep an eye here; and elsewhere; on de Armas."
2449,20190005,The latest adventure from a franchise that encourages us to find and express our purpose in life.
2450,20190005,Rare is a character who has both a one-note comedy beat (executed beautifully) and an extreme amount of emotional depth. What makes Forky so compelling is not his existential crisis; but his deep empathy for others...
2451,20190005,While not as good as the first two Toy Story pictures and probably not as good as the third; the heartfelt storyline and fun action scenes give audiences what they're looking for in a Pixar movie...
2452,20190005,It appears they have found another perfect ending for the franchise; and it's time to listen to that inner-voice and close the toy box once and for all.
2453,20190005,I appreciate the high-level creativity in the storytelling...although there's nothing new to see...
2454,20190005,Not as good as the prior two entries; this film is a fitting; if less impressive; conclusion.
2455,20190005,"The latest installment; ""Toy Story 4;"" is perhaps the bleakest (and most beautiful) of them all."
2456,20190005,Toy Story 4 is so good it's criminal. The legislation it flouts is the law of diminishing returns which governs movies with numbers after their names.
2457,20190005,Cooley's film quickens and deepens...
2458,20190005,Why the need for Part 4? There are new characters to merchandise!
2459,20190005,Toy Story 4 is so fast and light on its feet that it's easy to ignore that it's a pretty minor adventure.
2460,20190005,Pixar by the numbers; this third and largely unnecessary sequel to Toy Story delivers everything you'd expect from the animation studio; minus the warmth; wit; and dread.
2461,20190006,This is a magnificently wise; majestic; top-shelf work about the relentless passage of time and the fate awaiting us all; connected or not.
2462,20190006,One of Scorsese's masterworks.
2463,20190006,While it meanders at times; like the stories of many absentminded old men; it's rarely boring. Scorsese's longtime editor Thelma Schoonmaker -- a huge influence on the rhythms of his films -- remains a titan.
2464,20190006,Though it was somewhat overrated as a masterpiece of mobster cinema; Martin Scorsese's epic; occasionally funny; word-driven drama about the fate of union master Jimmy Hoffa is still a venerable; highly entertaining work
2465,20190006,"Melancholy and poetic. Think of it as Scorsese's monumental gangster epic equivalent of the late Sergio Leone's nearly four-hour masterpiece of ""Once Upon a Time in America"" (1984)."
2466,20190006,Surely only a filmmaker with plenty of life behind him - and plenty of such stories - could make a film so entertaining and yet so solemn and sad.
2467,20190006,It's the ultimate fusing of Scorsese's two sides... And even though it takes a while to get there; the movie is a masterpiece; one made by a man counting down his own years as if they were rosary beads.
2468,20190006,"""The Irishman"" moves slowly and pensively; invests in the natural rhythm of conversations and stops to smell the roses."
2469,20190006,Whether seen on the big screen or a small one; The Irishman is among 2019's best motion pictures and should receive its share of Oscar attention in 2020.
2470,20190006,"There are 209 minutes in ""The Irishman"" and not one of them is wasted."
2471,20190006,Veracity aside; The Irishman is Scorsese at the peak of his powers. It's not a minute too long at three hours and 20 minutes...
2472,20190006,It didn't take a genius to see that television was finally poised to win the war against movies. I just didn't expect my teacher to be leading the charge against theatrical exhibition.
2473,20190007,Great and refreshing take on the classic. Gerwig confirms her writing is a talent we haven't seen exploited yet and we certainly need to. [Full reviews in Spanish].
2474,20190007,Gerwig's adaptation makes sure to let the women watching know that their narratives; no matter how domestic or ordinary they may seem; are important.
2475,20190007,Greta Gerwig's experimental take adds clarity and wisdom to character developments and relationships that make the viewing experience more rewarding.
2476,20190007,An emotionally rich ode to family; aspiration; and hard work.
2477,20190007,In this version of the traditional melodrama; Gerwig lets her frantic energy seen in her first feature take a backseat; carving a triumphant tale about owning your own story.
2478,20190007,A fastidiously realised and impeccably cast rendition of Louisa May Alcott's classic novel.
2479,20190007,It's Little Women's deep generosity that cements it as a cinematic achievement.
2480,20190007,An absolutely lovely film that will make you feel so extremely good walking out of it.
2481,20190007,The latest adaptation gives the March sisters more power than ever.
2482,20190007,About 20 minutes in; the characters cease to be characters; they are now flesh and blood; our sisters. We feel their happiness and despond; their cold feet and warm hearts; their slights and loves. It's a masterful; passionate; all-in kind of adaptation.
2483,20190007,Greta Gerwig's take on Louisa May Alcott's novel is intelligent and fleet; refreshing if not radical; and as organic in its feminist convictions as it is in its depiction of close-knit sororal love.
2484,20190007,A work of poetic smuggling: a movie made within the norms of the industry that also reflects Gerwig's own personal artistic ideas; ideals; and obsessions.
2485,20190008,The story; the players; and the two leads are all endearing in the very best of ways -- warm; funny; charming and bloody lovely.
2486,20190008,Hilarious and fascinating look at growing up nerdy.
2487,20190008,A fresh spin on the coming-of-age storyline with a new female POV...one of the best of the year.
2488,20190008,It stars a pair of credible; three-dimensional characters; and combines hilarious moments with plausible dramatic elements. [Full review in Spanish]
2489,20190008,Powered by a quartet of female writers and endearing lead performances; Booksmart truly stands out from its peers by unabashedly celebrating female friendship and intelligence.
2490,20190008,With Booksmart; Olivia Wilde turns in a flawless debut that is a hilariously heartwarming coming of age story.
2491,20190008,A solid debut for Wilde; but really puts Dever and Feldstein on the map.
2492,20190008,Booksmart puts a fresh spin on the coming-of-age night-of comedy because it's focused on two girls; one of whom is also queer.
2493,20190008,It's more John Hughes than Judd Apatow; and it's a little more Bridesmaids than Lady Bird...a success on [its] own terms...
2494,20190008,"First; the good news: it's immediately clear that Wilde is a filmmaker by vocation... If anything; the film is polished to a fault: the marketing term ""elevated genre;"" most frequently applied to horror; feels equally apt here."
2495,20190008,It's raunchy and kind of gross at times; but there is such heart; sweetness; and honesty about high school.
2496,20190008,...witty; raucous; perfectly played and eventually packs an emotional wallop.
2497,20190009,Wang's film simmers on a low flame; which is also the source of its charm and the empathy it stirs.
2498,20190009,The Farewell is among 2019's best films. It becomes deeper; funnier and more resonant with repeated viewing; too.
2499,20190009,So well-acted; you felt it. I thought it was a really; really solid movie; and I was very surprised by it.
2500,20190009,What The Farewell isolates so incisively is a sense of cultural melancholia specific to the immigrant experience; a mourning for something lost in the process of existing between worlds.
2501,20190009,The Farewell may be a difficult sit for anyone who has lost a loved one; but it's a worthwhile one as it keenly captures the glorious awfulness and fabulous ridiculousness of family.
2502,20190009,A poignant look at cultural identity and its place in modern society.
2503,20190009,The film could have had wit; attitude; poignancy; style - or any single one of the four. Instead it slithers along; shallow and soapy.
2504,20190009,Panic and self-doubt are at the heart of [the] movie...
2505,20190009,Wang's family story is modestly affecting and deserves an audience; but if it does prompt thoughts about weighing up the importance of emotional truth; they mainly come afterwards.
2506,20190009,You'll be spewing with tears before the first act is done.
2507,20190009,The Farewell is a comedy of warmth and bracing honesty. Simply put; it's one of the best films of the year.
2508,20190009,What follows is a series of hackneyed scenes about the different interpersonal relationships within the family; centering on the heroine's bond with her grandmother.
2509,20190010,One particularly symbolic scene involving Driver and a small key-chain blade says more about the nature of bad divorces than most films on the subject.
2510,20190010,A contemplative and heartbreaking depiction of marriage sacrificed at the altar of ego.
2511,20190010,Here are two likable actors swimming upstream in a current that wants to drown them in detestable melodrama; and for nearly every scene they occupy shared space; we find ourselves praying for psychological intervention.
2512,20190010,Driver and Johansson truly make the most of their performances; creating real; flesh and blood characters that are as definitive to cinema as Meryl Streep and Dustin Hoffman in Kramer vs. Kramer.
2513,20190010,Baumbach's film is sincere; even affectionate; as it follows this disintegrating family unit.
2514,20190010,Good script; good performances; the whole thing comes together really very well [and] the supporting performances really balance the tone effectively.
2515,20190010,By the end; you're rooting for both Charlie and Nicole; hoping they find their own happiness despite all the bad things and the pain they caused one another.
2516,20190010,Johansson and Driver are remarkably; heartbreakingly good in every scene; showing their characters' journeys to an unflinching camera; letting the gap between them get wider yet unable; for their son's sake; to completely walk away.
2517,20190010,It's a triumph; a mix of pleasure and pain that cuts so deep it leaves a scar. It hurts; but it hurts so good.
2518,20190010,The entire cast is rock solid; with Johansson and Driver turning in two of the very best performances of their careers.
2519,20190010,At its best; this movie is searing. It pinpoints many of the little talked-about aspects of divorce that seem the least significant but hurt the most.
2520,20190010,Noah Baumbach's latest film portrays both sides of a messy divorce; for once.
2521,20190011,Getting the most unhateable actor in America to play one of the most beloved American cultural figures is a home run before you even step up to the plate.
2522,20190011,Marielle Heller did a charming and heartwarming movie that truly understands the complexity of its characters and tackles them with ambitious form. [Full review in Spanish]
2523,20190011,A Beautiful Day In The Neighborhood is a movie that everyone should watch. It proves that the best thing to do; in any situation; is to be kind and forgive.
2524,20190011,A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood is like an anti-Joker in how it confronts the mental health challenges of its main character. Instead of nihilism; hopelessness and violence; this film opts for hope.
2525,20190011,But credit goes to Hanks; who doesn't hide Rogers' blemishes and problems. His version of Rogers chooses not to give in to negativity; and shows that one can rise above life's struggles and still be the good guy.
2526,20190011,"Director Heller gets credit for the bold choice of avoiding making Rogers a ""real"" person in typical biopic fashion. Rather; the portrait of him is impressionist and poetic; an image that captures Rogers more as a feeling more than a collection of facts."
2527,20190011,That said; the real anchor of the film is Rhys; who makes bitterness and mistrust strangely compelling.
2528,20190011,It's a film that really shouldn't work. One constantly feels that at any moment the entire thing will degenerate into vat of marshmellow.
2529,20190011,So; you can weep gentle tears as you; exhorted by Hanks; think of the ones you love and of Hanks himself. Since we are all sitting tight in our own neighborhoods right now; this is a beautiful way to spend a day.
2530,20190011,Hanks does it again. His portrayal of Mr. Rogers is strong enough to make this family drama an endearing and fun little movie. [Full review in Spanish].
2531,20190011,Hanks aligns so closely with the real Fred Rogers.
2532,20190011,Hanks offers a magnificent performance as Rogers; capturing the TV legend's essence.
2533,20190012,Jenkins tells unsentimental stories of hardship and injustice. Yet; at the same time; he also evokes romantic and intensely resonant imagery. With one foot in the real and the other in the ethereal; Barry Jenkins has crafted another masterpiece.
2534,20190012,If Beale Street Could Talk is an extraordinary film with so much to say about our past and our future and a society that still hasn't learn its lessons all that well.
2535,20190012,If Beale Street Could Talk is beautiful and poignant filmmaking. Spine-tinglingly brilliant.
2536,20190012,3 Time Emmy Winner Regina King gives another charged and determined performance. You cling to every word and piece of advice she has. The film may be quiet; but it packs a punch.
2537,20190012,Director Barry Jenkins has broken the rule that mediocre books make the best movies. He takes Baldwin's dauntingly nonlinear literary structure and makes it smooth and easily understandable.
2538,20190012,It might not shine as brightly as MOONLIGHT; but IF BEALE STREET COULD TALK is a wonderful film. It doesn't just talk; it can walk the walk as well.
2539,20190012,Holier-than-thou black sanctity. Glutinous gospellings of martyrdom.
2540,20190012,The final reel is painful (the bee sting of bigotry). The ending is tough. The compensation resides in the elegant and searing film-making of Jenkins.
2541,20190012,Jenkins doesn't scratch the surface of the black American experience. He takes you deep into its bones and suggests that far less has changed than the naive may believe.
2542,20190012,Just as the novel version of If Beale Street Could Talk moves between love story and protest novel; a balance Baldwin strikes throughout many of his works; Jenkins' adaptation uses flashbacks to oscillate between two worlds.
2543,20190012,Jenkins's If Beale Street Could Talk is a gorgeous; enveloping film -- and one of its most poignant triumphs is how vividly it captures the depth and complication of intimacy among its black characters.
2544,20190012,Lyrical and very transporting.
2545,20190013,Some of the comedy doesn't land well; or there is too much of it in a row; but in general I feel the film is a good bit of harmless fun; full of action and great set pieces.
2546,20190013,Spider-Man: Far From Home isn't perfect; but it does rise to the occasion. And as the opening film in this new chapter of the MCU; it sets the stage for the bigger and better to come.
2547,20190013,This is an easygoing summer-movie trifle; make no mistake; and yet... In years to come; this may seem very much a movie of its era.
2548,20190013,Ultimately; Spider-Man: Far From Home is a fun; energetic; and entertaining blockbuster; and far better than what's been in cinemas these last two months.
2549,20190013,I didn't like it as a movie overall; but as an experience...
2550,20190013,You could chalk it up to Marvel fatigue; but we should call it like it is: it's just not as good as Homecoming; and a lackluster endcap to the stellar phase 3.
2551,20190013,This mischievous film never tires of teasing the conventions and traditions of the genre.
2552,20190013,It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter; the beginning of a new one; an epilogue; and a palate cleanser all at once.
2553,20190013,Even with a plot that builds off the emotional heft of Endgame; another mediocre villain; heavy dose of Disney Channel-level romance and too much clunky shtick... made this feel qualitatively more like a middle-weight contender.
2554,20190013,"I like that ""Far From Home"" is trying something new and that its humor feels more real than the ironic cracks in most superhero movies. I just wish its good pieces all came together more satisfyingly."
2555,20190013,The stakes this time turn out to be considerably lower; and your friendly neighborhood Spider-Teen is arguably just the guy to bring things down to Earth and reestablish a human scale.
2556,20190013,The best part of Far From Home is Samuel L. Jackson; whose Nick Fury single-handedly elevates the movie from a C to a B+.
2557,20190014,"In his assemblage of the film; Almodóvar imbues ""Pain & Glory"" with a wonderfully lyrical lilt. He weaves the film's many themes gracefully; with the measured contemplation of a musician putting together an album."
2558,20190014,As slow and meandering as the film feels at times; DP José Luis Alcaine's eye is a constant that enlivens the screen when the narrative struggles to.
2559,20190014,We are seeing the world - in all its sadness and beauty - through his eyes. Banderas brings it all to life.
2560,20190014,Banderas is the best part of the movie; with a tour-de-force performance...a master filmmaker forging a new path...
2561,20190014,Pain and Glory is a patient film; it quietly sits in wait; encouraging you to create new memories by revisiting your own old memories.
2562,20190014,Pain and Glory not only shows a brilliant artist still operating at the peak of his creative powers; but also reunites him with his most important male lead.
2563,20190014,"""Pain and Glory"" stays with you; and grows richer with reflection."
2564,20190014,There's plenty of artfulness on display in the intertwining of life and what gets made of it; but also a fair helping of artifice. Art imitating life; but also improving it a bit.
2565,20190014,"Antonio Banderas gives his best; most committed performance in years as a film director looking back over his life in ""Pain and Glory;"" a typically rich; layered film from director Pedro Almodóvar."
2566,20190014,A masterful; melancholy; tender; lacerating self-examination; filled with colour and light and the ghosts of those he has loved. Almodovar at 70; and perhaps astonishing to himself; continues to grow.
2567,20190014,Almodóvar shows us that; even after nearly two dozen features over several decades; he can still hold an audience in his hand - and surprise it.
2568,20190014,While still embracing the visual facades that make his films such a pleasure to watch; Pain and Glory finds him stripping away the emotional facades; bringing us closer to him than ever before.
2569,20190015,As a technical exercise; Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood is wonderfully realized...it would be fun to be able to explore the world of 1969 Los Angeles that Tarantino has reconstructed. If only there was anything else redeeming in this film.
2570,20190015,Still; this imperfect Hollywood fairy tale is largely enjoyable with many memorable elements and is ultimately essential viewing for movie fans.
2571,20190015,A long plod through Tarantino's reflections on Hollywood in 1969 that are summed up pretty well by the shrug emoji.
2572,20190015,A period piece so painstakingly constructed that it shames the rest of the genre... The movie makes its world of 1969 Los Angeles feel incredibly lived-in; not merely a look back but a transporting experience.
2573,20190015,This is often surprisingly funny in a playful way; reveling in the textures of its setting and as much about celebrating the simple pleasures of sturdily made entertainment as meditating on age and the passing of an era.
2574,20190015,Kudos go to Tarantino for fully invested into DiCaprio and Pitt's characters respectively; as he gives them ample rooms for them to shine with their roles.
2575,20190015,Don't mistake me: This movie is good. It all depends on how hard you're willing to work to justify its pleasures.
2576,20190015,A bittersweet; complex; conversation-starting look back at the film business at the close of a tumultuous decade; Once Upon a Time in Hollywood also works as a strong argument for why it's too soon for Tarantino to pack it in.
2577,20190015,The plot is a tapestry template that drops in characters like shining beads and watches the story weave slowly around them.
2578,20190015,It is Tarantino's best; bravest and most confrontationally impudent movie since Pulp Fiction.
2579,20190015,There seems little doubt that every detail of the tableau has been selected to give [Tarantino] pleasure; and we are being permitted to witness a private ritual of self-gratification; on more than one level.
2580,20190015,It's an unharmonious clash between two separate ideas: the director's personal anxieties and the real story of the end of the 1960s.
2581,20190016,[Shazam] was the hero of a movie serial back in the '40s; and a silly Saturday-morning show in the '70s; but this is his first full-on feature treatment; and it's a lot of fun.
2582,20190016,The movie is so endearing; you almost want it to hit a few more tropes just to see how Shazam does it. Not bad for a new superhero.
2583,20190016,Shazam! is a great second act in the new Worlds of DC. It is a fun family superhero movie that never tries too hard to be what it wants to be.
2584,20190016,There's real joy to be had by watching Shazam; a contagious feeling of childish glee and enthusiasm.
2585,20190016,Shazam! is 20 percent too long; 20 percent too sappy; and; let's face it; kinda stupid. The movie's monsters; who are supposed to be scary; just seem like typically cheap DC CGI. But little boys will love it. Little girls will love it.
2586,20190016,Perhaps a case could be made that there is a good film waiting to burst out of Shazam! but no matter how many times you say the magic word; it never makes an appearance.
2587,20190016,You can't help but root for a protagonist who; once he realises he has superpowers; uses them to make strangers pay for selfies with him and to pose at the top of the steps where Stallone's Rocky Balboa used to do his workouts.
2588,20190016,It's a bummer when the bad guy shows up and Shazam becomes like every other superhero movie - worse; really; because the storyboarding is so poor that it's hard to tell what's going on. In the climax; Sandberg misses nearly every one of his marks.
2589,20190016,For a long; glorious stretch; Shazam! plays like the anti-Nolan antidote it is.
2590,20190016,After lazy reliance on phoney gravitas and blundering with its first serious stab at levity with Aquaman; DC has found a comic torch-bearer of pure heart to illuminate the path of righteousness ahead.
2591,20190016,Pretty bland... A little too light; fluffy; and negligible.
2592,20190016,It's an interesting departure for Swedish horror director David F. Sandberg (Annabelle: Creation; Lights Out); who proves he has more tricks up his sleeve than just things that go bump in the night.
2593,20190017,The wonder of modern technology has conjured up these sensational pictures; much in the same way that it transported human life out of this world half a century ago.
2594,20190017,Going budget class on this cinematic journey to traditional theater screens will thrill; but traveling First Class via the optimized IMAX format amplifies the WOW! of the film...
2595,20190017,Apollo 11 is worthwhile simply for this unearthed footage. It looks astonishing; the mint-condition film flawlessly transferred into digital; and then synced to the original audio files perfectly.
2596,20190017,Built entirely of eye-popping archival footage; it faithfully recreates the 1969 moonshot and successfully recaptures the awe of it all.
2597,20190017,The meticulously told odyssey of the first moon landing amazingly feels new; alive and; at times; as if a script we know from history might not happen.
2598,20190017,"""Apollo 11"" is a documentary that deserves to be seen on the largest TV screen and with the best sound system."
2599,20190017,Todd Douglas Miller's 50th-anniversary docu-buster is everything it should be; with the possible exception of exciting.
2600,20190017,The director avoids gimmicks or embellishment. Strapping three men to the top of a rocket and blasting them into space is; it turns out; sufficiently gripping on its own.
2601,20190017,Sometimes gush is the only appropriate response and the amazingness never gets any less amazing.
2602,20190017,Go. Rush out. Find this film now. Find it on the biggest possible screen; accompanied by the best; loudest sound. And sit back and marvel.
2603,20190017,It's a film that makes history seem freshly minted -- a unique work of restoration made possible by the discovery of a cache of previously unreleased audio recordings and large-format footage.
2604,20190017,As a testament to the wonders of science and space; it's extraordinary; as a testament to the triumph of cinema and mankind; it's more a small step than a giant leap.
2605,20190018,A sleek and depth filled story about human ingenuity; the thrill of competition; and the bond between two men of differing philosophies but a common goal.
2606,20190018,Fatherhood is a fragile; precious thing; and Ford v Ferrari  captures this well.
2607,20190018,It's an increasingly rare example of non-franchise entertainment for adults; it's carpentered extremely well; and it offers the sort of generous; heedless fun that only a big studio movie can.
2608,20190018,...it happens to be great filmmaking and features an intense and richly developed script; as well as two dazzling lead performances.
2609,20190018,A good movie; with enjoyable performances by Christian Bale; Matt Damon; and Jon Bernthal. All said; I felt bad for the Ferrari guy.
2610,20190018,"Coupled with Marco Beltrami and Buck Sanders' riveting score along with Phedon Papamichael's visually arresting cinematography and its impeccably revving sound design made ""Ford v Ferrari"" best experienced on the big screen."
2611,20190018,Mangold takes Ford v. Ferrari out of the simple realm of the genre without entirely losing the vibe.
2612,20190018,Ford v Ferrari takes the straightforward ethos of car racing-where the winner is whoever is the fastest-and lays bare the egotism and greed required for such a triumph.
2613,20190018,It's a far from perfect film; but a richly entertaining one; with a twist that only devoted petrolheads will know is coming.
2614,20190018,Think Iron Man and Captain America; only it's a (mostly) true story and what's at stake is not the fate of the universe; nor even an auto race; but the glorious; endless pursuit of perfection.
2615,20190018,Ford v Ferrari is a little too long; some scenes leave unnecessary skidmark trails. But the movie still has amiable style and energy to spare. It's fast but never furious.
2616,20190018,[Ford v Ferrari] may relish in the high life; but its final moments feel devastatingly hollow.
2617,20190019,Fun; but forgettable.
2618,20190019,One can't pretend that this Dolemite doesn't incorporate clichés; but we also can't deny it's an extremely entertaining exercise...
2619,20190019,It feels like the ideal fit for Netflix and as long as Murphy wants to chase good roles instead of an easy pay cheque; this should be the start of a late-career revival.
2620,20190019,Dolemite Is My Name is the kind of delightful film that celebrates the importance of keeping your creative flame alive; no matter how much it feels like your output is unwanted.
2621,20190019,It represents a sort of return to the golden days of Murphy; it's a vulgar; exaggerated; and hilarious film. The best thing he's done in years. [Full review in Spanish]
2622,20190019,As funny as it may be; this biography serves valid information with respect. Murphy is impecable. [Full review in Spanish].
2623,20190019,Murphy has shown he can do doleful as well as delirious; and his Dolemite is dynamite.
2624,20190019,Moore was always bigger-than-life and that's how Murphy plays him. It's a strong performance of a character worthy of biopic treatment. Dolemite lives!
2625,20190019,Murphy brings the spirit of Blaxploitation underdog Rudy Ray Moore to life; with tell-it-like-it-is radiance. His timing is; as always; cobra-strike precise...
2626,20190019,This riotous; poignant and uplifting true story couldn't have been told half as well without the singular magnetism and intensity of Eddie Murphy at its heart.
2627,20190019,It's well worth leaving the house for.
2628,20190019,Certainly the blue-chip cast that has shown up to support Murphy in the buoyant-but-superficial Netflix biopic Dolemite Is My Name is its own tribute to Moore's intersectional significance...
2629,20190020,The thing that elevates it above all else is the frenetic energy that infuses every scene; yet calibrated so perfectly so that it stays; barely; on the right side of frustrating. There's nothing more thrilling than that.
2630,20190020,Filmmakers Josh and Benny Safdie bought a quality product to audiences this past year and Sandler shines and the wholly unlikeable Ratner; but the film has flaws.
2631,20190020,Adam Sandler; who also did an impressive non-comedy turn in Punch-Drunk Love (2002); puts in a very strong performance as a hard-bitten businessman determined to survive in a world set out to destroy him.
2632,20190020,The Safdie brothers - whose last film; Good Time; redefined Robert Pattinson for a lot of moviegoers - are prepared to show you a new side of Adam Sandler.
2633,20190020,We are rocketed through Ratner's world - a place of permanently raised voices; propulsive camera work and blaring noise - accompanied by a pulsing score from Daniel Lopatin...
2634,20190020,What is there to say? Adam Sandler gives the performance of his career in a sea of diamond-encrusted Furbies.
2635,20190020,There is more to the Safdies' secret sauce than panic. At first glance the cast has the feel of a group of strangers grabbed at random from the sidewalk; yet it clicks and keeps clicking.
2636,20190020,This is the year's most exciting film. You can take that to the bank.
2637,20190020,Uncut Gems is a fairytale written by the hand of capitalism; where mystical highs are followed by crushing blows -- and there's always a price to pay.
2638,20190020,When relief finally comes; it's heartbreaking.
2639,20190020,Having looked at it closely; I'd say it's being over-valued. But not by much.
2640,20190020,It's a brilliantly exhausting movie that gaffer-tapes us to motormouth New York gem dealer and degenerate gambler Howard Ratner... The thrill and despair of the addict are palpable.
2641,20190021,Robert Eggers throws you headfirst into the deep end of the late 19th century with every period detail (and fart) intact.
2642,20190021,...this is the cinematic equivalent of that seal throwing an octopus at a kayaker. I am the kayaker; the octopus is The Lighthouse; and Robert Eggers is the seal throwing it in my face saying; 'here; take this and enjoy it; you heathen'.
2643,20190021,The process of degradation is shown in a superficial manner. It's a narrative flaw. [Full Review in Spanish]
2644,20190021,Robert Eggers's sophomore effort takes us on a surreal down spiral tale; boosted by Pattinson and Daffoe's heart wrenching performances and some of the most disturbing imagery Horror has offered in the past couple of years.
2645,20190021,It was interesting.
2646,20190021,The Lighthouse is a dense piece of cinema that's hard to pin down with a simple four paragraph review; and is only complicated by the film's overlapping tone colors and pitch-black; meme worthy humor.
2647,20190021,The visceral; disgusting; and irrefutably maddening theatrics of The Lighthouse are entrancing enough to have viewers happily giving themselves over to a beckoning siren by film's end.
2648,20190021,The actors play it big and bold in a visually striking; black and white horror show.
2649,20190021,Eggers masters the dangerous mix of horror and comedy.
2650,20190021,The longer the film goes on; the weirder it gets and the more it resembles a sitcom - The Odd Couple in sou'westers; a droll symphony of bodily functions; bubbling friction and all manner of desires that dare not speak their name.
2651,20190021,The Lighthouse is a pressure-cooker.
2652,20190021,American writer-director Robert Eggers excels at transporting you into the past and putting you under the skin of those you meet there. Persuading you to be glad that you came is another matter.
2653,20190022,What makes Rocketman so uneven is; ironically enough; a lack of understanding of what makes Elton John so iconic.
2654,20190022,Despite existing in a fantasy world; these characters are unmistakably human; and that; along with the masterful film craft on display; is what makes this one of the best musical biopics ever made.
2655,20190022,Sure; it's extravagant as expected; but Rocketman feels dull when portraying humanity in its characters; and that's all we need in a biography. [Full review in Spanish].
2656,20190022,It was fine.
2657,20190022,Good performances; fun songs.
2658,20190022,Elton John's robust rockers and heartfelt earnest songs all get their proper due in tonally perfect context.
2659,20190022,If you need somebody to recount the rise of a British rock god from pallid suburbia to the baroque extremes of fame; and to create a stir without causing too much of a fuss; Fletcher is your man.
2660,20190022,Rocketman never quite finds the wild momentum its characters seem to chase around in all those musical numbers.
2661,20190022,Rocketman has unusual dramatic heft for a jukebox musical; but that's a big curve on which to grade - the characters are still skin-deep.
2662,20190022,"""Rocketman"" is far from a drama of introspection-and; unfortunately; Egerton's performance; as directed by Fletcher; doesn't add to the protagonist's inner life."
2663,20190022,"Really; on the basis of ""Rocketman;"" you'd think Elton John never had a moment of fun."
2664,20190022,It's Taron Egerton as Elton John who carries and sells the film -- often backwards and in platform heels. Wild as it may sound to approach such a mercurial and marvelous character with beautiful restraint; Egerton's performance is meticulously calibrated.
2665,20190023,This musical feast was filmed a very long time ago - but it feels like only yesterday.
2666,20190023,"Amazing Grace is not a film you watch at home. You need to see this in a theater with commanding sound; a clear image on screen; and with an audience that isn't afraid to applaud and maybe shout out an ""Amen"" a time or twenty."
2667,20190023,Great musicians; a great performance; and that's all you really need.
2668,20190023,The result is a rough gem that will send your soul soaring.
2669,20190023,People got up and danced in church. They could not help themselves. That's the power she has. In the movie; I think it was James Cleveland who said that Aretha can sing anything. There is no doubt about that.
2670,20190023,Aretha documentary has soaring music but no narration.
2671,20190023,I felt wrung out at the end of this film. How incredible must it have been for those who were there in person.
2672,20190023,Franklin - focused; transcendentally beautiful and sweating profusely - takes us back to her roots.
2673,20190023,It's a perfect marriage of faith and showbiz; dignified by the fact that there's nothing ersatz about it. At its heart is an unfeigned exuberance; together with a sense of history; which informs the tears; laughter and fervent expressions of belief.
2674,20190023,In Amazing Grace; Aretha Franklin transcends the blues by saying a little prayer - or singing one - for all of us.
2675,20190023,The long-buried concert film is a tremendously powerful tribute to Aretha Franklin.
2676,20190023,The work as it stands now has considerable merit as a document recorded during a watershed period of the American civil rights movement. As a concert film; it's elevated by Franklin's powerhouse three-octave range and soulful phrasing.
2677,20190024,"You're liable to leave the theater with the strains of ""Mademoiselle from Armentieres"" ringing in your ears and visuals that will haunt you; possibly for years."
2678,20190024,It's like sending a 21st century filmmaking crew back to the turn of the last century to create an epic tale of intimately personal scope.
2679,20190024,No matter where you fall on the political spectrum; it's worth a look; to help make sense of the past and the role it played in creating our current world.
2680,20190024,In the now-total absence of those who witnessed the War; They Shall Not Grow Old feels like it will open audiences up for a new type of human connection with that era of our past.
2681,20190024,They Shall Not Grow Old is; at once; a technical marvel of historical importance; a deeply moving personal story of real-world heroes; and a timeless reminder that the atrocities of war must necessarily be avoided at all costs.
2682,20190024,The soldiers of WWI are here little more than motion-capture figures for Jackson's team to drape with colour and sound and stereoscopy. An army of Gollums: not wearied by age perhaps; but certainly contemned by technology.
2683,20190024,For the first time; those jittery; frenetic figures in ancient newsreels look and move like people you know.
2684,20190024,It's a true act of revival.
2685,20190024,"""They Shall Not Grow Old"" is a nearly great talking-head documentary in which the talking heads are never seen; only heard."
2686,20190024,There's a lot to debate here; and a lot to admire.
2687,20190024,This is as close as we can get to a full immersion into one of the most horrifying and ultimately pointless wars in modern history.
2688,20190024,What a superb way to remember the centenary of the end of the war. Hail Peter.
2689,20190025,For anyone with a long investment in Jia Zhengke's artistry; it's not hard to find what he achieves here to be another masterwork.
2690,20190025,...a mesmerizing mood piece about personal alienation and national dislocation.
2691,20190025,Jia Zhangke highlights the changes China have been experiencing during the last decades; as tradition has succumbed completely to technology; speed and the relentless pursue of money.
2692,20190025,Jia Zhangke has crafted a razor-sharp study of alienation and the corrosiveness of the patriarchy in contemporary China. And Tao is a revelation.
2693,20190025,As Qiao; Zhao [Tao] perfectly captures this complex character full of rage; emotion; and determination.
2694,20190025,A film that feels vividly alive all the way through its 136-minute running time.
2695,20190025,This is one of Zhangke's peak achievements: pure cinema; and a story of the underworld unlike anything you've seen before.
2696,20190025,Fascinating in its balance between microcosm and aerial view; but the performances definitely raise more emotional heat.
2697,20190025,The story is so richly novelistic the temptation is just to synopsise - but that risks not only spoilers; but failing to convey how much wonder is conjured beyond the plot; the stellar performance of Zhao; the insta-futuristic landscapes...
2698,20190025,Qiao scams philandering men; seemingly driven by the desire to punish Bin. And yet the film; slowly; reveals more melancholic aims; guiding a low-key finale towards a mournful evocation of what China has lost on the way towards modernisation.
2699,20190025,"As a gangster morality tale ""Ash"" is pretty mild; as a picture of China and Qiao's struggle it's much better."
2700,20190025,Zhao Tao just gives this powerhouse performance. It's so understated and her work -- and the film as a whole -- really do accumulate in their emotional resonance.
2701,20190026,The film-makers have managed to capture the lightning back in the bottle
2702,20190026,"""It should have little appeal to viewers who want a film to make at least some sense and not be ultra-violent."
2703,20190026,If you're the kind of person who can cheer when a knife toss is expertly executed; Chapter 3 should not be missed.
2704,20190026,The main things this film has going for it are its many well-staged action scenes; particularly its beautifully choreographed martial arts sequences and stunts. There is a lot of variety in these scenes.
2705,20190026,if you haven't got battle fatigue by the end you should prepare to suit up; reload and get ready to go out blazing.
2706,20190026,Like Mad Max: Fury Road; which was essentially a two-hour car chase; John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is an adrenaline soaked two-hour fight sequence that somehow manages to top what we witnessed in Chapter 2.
2707,20190026,"While ""John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum"" is an easy movie to recommend; it must be added that it's a hard movie to love."
2708,20190026,[I]t's a fun; entertaining romp that knows it's ridiculous from the moment that Wick takes out a towering 7-footer (the Philadelphia 76ers' Boban Marjanović) by beating him to death in a library with a book.
2709,20190026,It's rather like when Bond films went from Sean Connery to Roger Moore. Plenty of people will find this copacetic. A few will grouse about what's been lost: a touch of the real amid the merely fantastic.
2710,20190026,Superior exercises in action-movie formalism; the John Wick movies evoke everything from Fritz Lang's silent thrillers to Gene Kelly's musicals...
2711,20190026,Choreography is all that's on offer here. The increasingly convoluted fight scenes turn into lifeless spectacle in this ugly franchise.
2712,20190026,Reeves and Dacascos's brutal; climactic sparring session definitely leaves us wanting more; not to mention wondering about a potential Oscars sound editing category for shattering glass.
2713,20190027,The rough-edged charm of this redneck reworking of Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn radiates from the beautiful; warm performance by Zack Gottsagen...The unforced; uplifting vibe of the film makes it easy to understand its status as a sleeper hit.
2714,20190027,It's impossible to think of another actor who could pair desperation; care and naked compassion in the way that LaBeouf delivers in this film.
2715,20190027,For a screen newcomer; Zack Gottsagen turns out to be a real find. Far from just showing up and saying his lines; Gottsagen closely collaborated with the filmmakers in filling out and sharpening his character.
2716,20190027,There isn't a literal 'peanut butter falcon' in The Peanut Butter Falcon; but true to the title; it's a sticky-sweet film that soars on the strength of its easy-breezy cast.
2717,20190027,This dédebutbut feature from Tyler Nilson and Michael Schwartz is built upon a wonderfully naturalistic performance by Zack Gottsagen...
2718,20190027,What follows could be a bit corny. Indeed it is a bit corny; and that is part of its charm. Life is a bit corny too.
2719,20190027,And although essentially a fable; the film reminds us that the world is a complicated place and none of us are in any position to judge someone solely on their appearance or past actions - as tempting as that often might be.
2720,20190027,Gottsagen's performance shows that a disabled actor can still have the range that an able-bodied actor can have and still have the presence to drive a film all by themselves. Hopefully other film makers will take notice and follow suit.
2721,20190027,It's elevated beyond cloying corniness by the naturalness of its performances; from Zack Gottsagen's unstoppable energy to Shia LaBeouf's quiet warmth and crushed-but-not-broken spirit.
2722,20190027,The Peanut Butter Falcon is a sweet; tender and joyful portrayal of an unlikely friendship; and it won't fail to charm.
2723,20190027,A small and bittersweet indie that succeeds...
2724,20190027,The whole thing is just so damn sweet that I couldn't help but feel uplifted. Add to that a handful of genuine belly laughs and you've got yourself a winner.
2725,20190028,[Co-directors Tamara Kotevska and Ljubomir Stefanov] have created a masterclass of tension building
2726,20190028,The film is a documentary; which reminds us that Hatidze's story ultimately is not an allegory. There really is a Hatidze. And we are better-beautifully; transcendentally better-for having met her in this film.
2727,20190028,This movie about Europe's last wild beekeeper is complex; resonant; and visually magnificent.
2728,20190028,Directors Tamara Kotevska and Ljubomir Stefanov film their story with an effective blend of incredible intimacy and respectful distance.
2729,20190028,Austere yet incandescent documentary - fashioned into a poignant fable about ecological and environmental disaster.
2730,20190028,A tender story about human endurance
2731,20190028,Honeyland really is a miraculous feat; shot over three years as if by invisible camera - not a single furtive glance is directed towards the film-makers.
2732,20190028,"Fancy a northern Macedonian film about beekeeping? ""You will; Oscar; you will;"" I am tempted to say."
2733,20190028,Although it starts as a meditation on the hardship and rhythms of rural life; Ljubomir Stefanov and Tamara Kotevska's documentary becomes something more intimate.
2734,20190028,Brief and to the point; Honeyland proves more meditative than its premise suggests.
2735,20190028,"This is one of the best movies of the year... Over and over again while I was watching it; I was asking myself ""How did they get that shot?"""
2736,20190028,Hatidze's story is heartbreakingly moving; and needs no heavy editorialising. Her strength; dignity; resilience and humanity carry the film's truth and weight.
2737,20190029,[Rachel] Lears mixes [Alexandria] Ocasio-Cortez's rise with the campaigns of three other Brand New Congress candidates around the country. And they're sometimes more compelling than the future congresswoman.
2738,20190029,It's incredible how [Rachel] Lears captured AOC's improbable ascent; and for that reason alone people will get a kick out of this film.
2739,20190029,It's impossible not to find yourself cheering and feeling a lump in your throat at this David versus Goliath story. But also find your heart breaking with the tears of loss of those other candidates who were less fortunate.
2740,20190029,Lears makes efficient use of time; diving just enough into the lives of the candidates to understand where they're coming from; but not making them come across so weepy as to be ineffectual.
2741,20190029,An average documentary that will inspire; anger; and perhaps even motivate viewers to change the world.
2742,20190029,Robin Blotnick's editing bobs and weaves between their personal and professional lives; refusing to stuff them into any gendered; ethnic; or social boxes.
2743,20190029,Even though we know the outcome...the campaign progress remains enthralling. Mostly because it's a fascinating snapshot of modern politics in flux...and a hopeful; ultimately moving account of idealism in action.
2744,20190029,As the primary results pour in; Knock Down the House becomes the electoral equivalent of the Death Star raid in Star Wars.
2745,20190029,In the end; Lears finds the hope that she is looking for. It's hard to resist a candidate who is so fresh; so new; so perfectly now.
2746,20190029,Everyone likes an underdog story; and when the underdog is as eloquent; passionate and righteous as these four women are; the final reels of this film feel like a Rocky movie.
2747,20190029,Regardless of one's partisan leanings; it's hard to resist the dramatic momentum of these intertwined narratives.
2748,20190029,They're Democrats; but the movie should be inspiring to anyone who wishes to see firsthand the immeasurable value of good retail politics and hard work.
2749,20190030,The most moving aspect of the movie is without a doubt seeing Shia LaBeouf play the role of his father: pure catharsis; empathy; and humility. [Full Review in Spanish]
2750,20190030,It surprises precisely because of its universal outlook with which it deals with the relationship between father and teenage son. [Full Review in Spanish]
2751,20190030,Is quite remarkable in its softness; in its emotion; and in [Shia LaBeouf's] heartfelt manner in showing his dad the type of love he deserved when he needed it the most.
2752,20190030,Honey Boy is a deeply-personal; therapeutic and heartfelt film that doesn't overplay with its dreamlike capability
2753,20190030,Starkly sad and sensitive; this is Shia LeBeouf's memory drama in which he plays a fictionalized version of his own father.
2754,20190030,Honey Boy is a messy triumph for screenwriter LaBeouf and director Har'el.
2755,20190030,The icing on the cake of [LaBeouf's] indie redemption phase.
2756,20190030,This looks on paper like a self-aggrandising vanity project; but it is very well directed and performed.
2757,20190030,The film delicately bears its scars and finds peace by acknowledging how childhood pains can make and break us.
2758,20190030,This is bleak stuff. But it's also hellishly entertaining.
2759,20190030,Playing out mainly in the skid-row motel in Los Angeles where father and son live; Alma Har'el's dreamlike film leavens the grimness with humanity and humour...
2760,20190030,A movie that could easily have crashed and burned. That it does not has something to do with the shared intensity of character and performance. All three main actors share the stage as equals and the level of commitment is remarkable.
2761,20190031,Stephen Merchant; The Rock; and the WWE kinda knocked it out of the park with this one. Fighting With My Family is a dope; heartfelt movie with all the bumps and excitement that's in pro wrestling.
2762,20190031,If this is an indicator of the future of WWE Productions' output; we can look forward to an unlikely heel-turn for the company into making -- gasp -- good films.
2763,20190031,Director and writer Stephen Merchant shoehorns [Florence] Pugh into a typical sports underdog plot... Yet despite the very familiar and familial feel; this one only lags occasionally.
2764,20190031,It never quite settles into a real comedic stride; but there are enough touching themes about the impact of thwarted dreams; having conviction in your own sense of self; and sparks of Stephen Merchant's wit to endear the audience to the story.
2765,20190031,It ends up convincing both on a dramatic level; and on a somewhat more visceral level. [Full review in Spanish]
2766,20190031,The film brilliantly balances the wrestling components and the family drama - making this a really charming watch for all the family.
2767,20190031,It's a ramshackle movie at best; stuffed with cliches; cartoonish yet visually inert; a plea for non-conformity that never veers far from the commercial playbook.
2768,20190031,We know how it's going to turn out; but that doesn't matter because what you're watching along the way is so entertaining.
2769,20190031,The film is basic and predictable; but its sincerity is hard to overlook.
2770,20190031,Stephen Merchant's film about an American wrestling family is a triumph; with a star turn from Florence Pugh.
2771,20190031,Florence Pugh's knockout performance is the winner in this zesty wrestling drama.
2772,20190031,Yet realism; emotional or otherwise; is beside the point: this is a film that prints the legend; perhaps on the assumption that nothing is too cornball for true wrestling fans.
2773,20190032,Hilarious and very entertaining.
2774,20190032,If you do go into this film expecting one thing; be prepared for your mind to be changed by the end.
2775,20190032,Paying affectionate homage to genre film-making while simultaneously shredding its conventions; Shinichiro Ueda's debut feature is a masterly coup de cinéma.
2776,20190032,Beyond the fantastic backstage comedy; it also serves as a satire of the media industry. [Full review in Spanish]
2777,20190032,One Cut of the Dead is progressively enjoyable and it works; in part; because it doesn't. After all; the whole movie is built on failure.
2778,20190032,One Cut of the Dead is easily an instant genre classic that renews my hope for zombie films with its triumphant story of one family united in their struggle against the undead.
2779,20190032,Ueda's film goes on to indulge [its] curiosity in endless head-spinningly clever ways - turning a riotous genre treat into a full-hearted love-letter to both filmmaking and film-watching alike.
2780,20190032,It's a movie that rescues the tired zombie trope - without insisting on metaphor or satire.
2781,20190032,A genuinely clever and loving tribute to cinema at its most homemade.
2782,20190032,"A master class in endless narrative inventiveness and an ode to the resourceful and collaborative spirit of hands-on filmmaking; ""One Cut of the Dead"" amounts to an explosively hilarious rarity."
2783,20190032,You have to want to invest in his characters in order for One Cut of the Dead to really take off.
2784,20190032,Ueda... manages to reinvigorate two of the most tired tropes cluttering our media landscape: art as meta commentary on art; and explosive diarrhea.
2785,20190033,No one had bothered to examine the origins of Colombian drug trafficking from an anthropological point of view... Therein lies the originality of a film like Birds of Passage. [Full review in Spanish]
2786,20190033,Boldly [blends] western and gangster movie tropes with anthropology and magic realism to create a dramatically formulaic; but intoxicating audiovisual assault on the senses.
2787,20190033,Cristina Gallego and Ciro Guerra draw on the ideas of a narco thriller without wallowing in them.
2788,20190033,As effectively violent and entertaining as Birds may be; there is a real current of bitterness and tragedy running through it.
2789,20190033,The directors succeed in portraying two of the most important pillars of Colombian culture that; in turn; shape the two great concerns of the Colombian. [Full review in Spanish]
2790,20190033,The female-forward characters and the matrilineal Wayúu tribe the movie orbits have gone surprisingly under-explored by film critics.
2791,20190033,A beguiling façade masks a rather commonplace gangster narrative.
2792,20190033,It's a story with a striking sense of place - especially the windswept plains - and some wonderfully taciturn performances; notably from Martínez and José Vicente Cote as Rapayet's wizened; dignified uncle.
2793,20190033,[I thought] this film just had a really distinctive personality and really beautiful cinematography.
2794,20190033,There are ethnographic films and there are crime films. I can't recall a film before this that does both successfully - but wait; there's more. Birds of Passage is also an epic tragedy... It's a breathtaking; moody; elegiac piece of work.
2795,20190033,Ciro Guerra and Cristina Gallego's follow-up to their 2015 gem Embrace of the Serpent is a stunner.
2796,20190033,Yet even as Birds of Passage fetishizes its dreary mood; it excels at tracking the gradual impact of crime across generations less invested in playing by ancient rules.
2797,20190034,What a revelation... It's quite stunning.
2798,20190034,"It's interesting to watch Tracy Edwards' maturation as a person -- she goes from claiming that she hates the word ""feminist"" to wholeheartedly embracing it."
2799,20190034,Without revealing too much; it's fair to say Maiden; Edwards and her crew did better than most people expected.
2800,20190034,Luckily; this isn't the type of film that coasts on its inherently interesting story. It's edited with gusto; lining up its talking heads to emulate conversations.
2801,20190034,Director Alex Holmes gracefully cuts back and forth from stirring archival footage of the Whitbread Round the World Yacht Race as cameras get up close and personal with the female crew.
2802,20190034,This is an amazing story of a woman; a boat and a crew that did something that was thought by many to be impossible.
2803,20190034,"""Maiden"" concludes so movingly; with such perfect symbolism; that it rivals any scripted sports drama."
2804,20190034,Using archival footage and fresh recollections; director Alex Holmes offers an illuminating look into the weird world of jibs and rigging in a film that transcends the action of the sport.
2805,20190034,A taut; gripping documentary about one young woman's dream...
2806,20190034,"""Maiden"" makes sense of her journey and tells a story whose tidal waves were felt far beyond the deck of her ship."
2807,20190034,Maiden is simply riveting; a story of grandeur and sweep that's also moving and intimate because there are so many naked emotions in play.
2808,20190034,[A] heartwarming documentary.
2809,20190035,The result is a profoundly intimate yet horrifically heartbreaking film-a powerful document of love and injustice that traverses an array of emotions.
2810,20190035,It is confronting and occasionally shocking. But also warm; moving; often surprisingly funny and utterly crucial.
2811,20190035,It's so very important that we take every opportunity we get to open the window into the world beyond our own lives to see stories like this one.
2812,20190035,A remarkable documentary and important contribution to a collective portrait of the Syrian tragedy...
2813,20190035,I have rarely seen a documentary film as powerful as For Sama. The viewer is transported into the Syrian city of Aleppo to experience the very nasty civil war at first hand.
2814,20190035,It is an essential documentation of what is happening to other people in the world who are just like us; but through no fault of their own are forced into the most terrifying and impossible circumstances.
2815,20190035,For Sama is one of the most profoundly intimate depictions of the Syrian conflict ever put to film.
2816,20190035,You leave understanding why for Al-Kateab the past is something she wants to live with every day.
2817,20190035,This is devastating. So hard to watch; so heartbreaking; and so inspiring.
2818,20190035,"Even when it's drenched in grief; ""For Sama"" contains the seeds of hope."
2819,20190035,They display a striking buoyancy; which the film captures in moving detail -- there is laughter; there is comradeship; there is life even in the face of horror.
2820,20190035,[A] dynamic and poignantly personal account of a city's systematic destruction.
2821,20190036,So much of The Hidden World is stuffed with filler material. But in certain wordless moments; this grand final entry really sings.
2822,20190036,The film feels like it's flying on empty... This is clearly the end of the franchise; one that gave great pleasure and stayed on too long.
2823,20190036,"The movie could easily be called ""How To End Your Trilogy."""
2824,20190036,For some; it'll be a moving conclusion to an epic series. For others; it'll be one less kids' franchise to worry about.
2825,20190036,"""How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World"" still has the power to warm a cold heart; but the fire is less bright."
2826,20190036,DeBlois struggles mightily to connect the resolution of one storyline to the resolution of the other; and it proves to be an overwhelming task. Still; it's a painless watch; with plenty of visual oohs and emotional aahs; and will surely leave fans happy.
2827,20190036,Not as noteworthy as the previous ones but still important in its own way. A great closure. [Full review in Spanish].
2828,20190036,A perfect conclusion to one of the best animated series in cinema.
2829,20190036,There is sadness but there is joy to be had in The Hidden World; ending the franchise like on this high was the best way to say goodbye to Hiccup; Toothless and the gang.
2830,20190036,Overall; this feels like a sequel made for the sake of it with little by way of inspiration. It provides a neat conclusion to the larger story but is liable to leave fans of the original feeling short-changed.
2831,20190036,A satisfying conclusion with its themes of growing up and moving on that bring an emotional weight to the story.
2832,20190036,The kids who first discovered How to Train Your Dragon are teenagers now; contemplating their place in the world; and their animated friends have grown up with them.
2833,20190037,Brian Dennehy delivers devastating low key turn as kind but also gruff Korean war vet; who befriends lonely boy. Hong Chau is another big plus
2834,20190037,Done so well and so delicately...unforced; beautifully performed; understated and quite lovely...I liked the feel and texture of this movie...the intimacy of it.
2835,20190037,Driveways doesn't necessarily provide answers; but it looks to find solace in decisions; with the lives we choose to leave; and the relationships we forge.
2836,20190037,Rewarding gem about friendship and life's changes; swearing.
2837,20190037,"""Driveways"" is a sweet; funny and genuinely moving tale that features Dennehy at his subtle best."
2838,20190037,What resonates is the movie's understanding of how we come and go through life; of how a house becomes a home; of how even the smallest acts of kindness can open doors that never quite close.
2839,20190037,There can be a very fine line between a movie that is delicate and understated and a movie that is lazy and undernourished. Ahn is slowly perfecting the former.
2840,20190037,A movie that's impressively; if not stubbornly understated; where life stories come from select bits of precise dialogue; with lovingly rendered characters put into a collection of scenes that simply allow us to live with them.
2841,20190037,This is such a lovely; delicate; and quietly moving film.
2842,20190037,This is one of those quiet gems where we get dropped into the lives of a handful of characters at what turns out to be a crucial turning point in all their lives.
2843,20190037,"""For a movie about isolation and the risk of reaching out; it's a generous example of how nourishing a sense of connection really is."""
2844,20190037,The three lead actors carry the movie and do the heavy dramatic lifting gracefully; their sheer presence reaches far beyond the confines of the story.
2845,20190038,I did not see this one coming. The Jennifer Lopez Oscar talk is for real.
2846,20190038,The thing is; J-Lo is undoubtedly in the hardcore crime movie that Hustlers aaaaaalmost is. From the moment she steps into frame; she's an unstoppable force.
2847,20190038,Hustlers is a fun movie that elated me with its care for the women in such private and intimate positions...
2848,20190038,J.Lo is a star.
2849,20190038,The performances are great.
2850,20190038,Indecently charismatic; Jennifer Lopez swaggers; struts and pole-dances her way through this sizzling comedy-drama.
2851,20190038,This is a deeply feminist film; one where men are given less screen time than the cameoing Cardi B and Lizzo.
2852,20190038,A lean; fierce take on the nature of female empowerment in an inherently corrupted world.
2853,20190038,It's meant as a compliment when strong females are called ballsy; but it would be truer to say that J-Lo's extraordinary creation is vagina-y.
2854,20190038,J-Lo is the only reason to see it.
2855,20190038,As good as Lopez and her onscreen accomplice Constance Wu are; they can't act what isn't in the script; other than a dedicated work ethic; we're never given access to their thoughts.
2856,20190038,The hard-boiled exchanges between the women have a genuine exuberance; recalling Hollywood movies of the 1930s where showgirls trade wisecracks backstage.
2857,20190039,Blending social realism with lyrical notes of horror; Diop runs through gender roles and how standing against the tide is the biggest quest of them all.
2858,20190039,At its heart; Atlantics is a story about agency and the struggle to chart one's own path; free of societal constraints and expectations about what one should do.
2859,20190039,The film is as aesthetically beautiful as it is a visionary social commentary.
2860,20190039,This complicated but beautiful exercise in cinematography never denies the heart of its story. [Full Review in Spanish]
2861,20190039,Diop's ability to alchemise her supernatural narrative with such effective social commentary is something very special.
2862,20190039,Rich soaking colors; lots of shots which emphasize the obstructions of the social/physical environment...
2863,20190039,The French-African director practically invents a new genre - Senegalese gothic - and does it with such insouciance that all you can do is rub your eyes. It's so beautiful.
2864,20190039,Yet the film is so convinced of its seriousness and artistic prowess (gorgeous; long and inherently disturbing shots of the ocean abound) that it becomes mildly; and pleasingly; intoxicating.
2865,20190039,[Diop] has woven all these concerns and more into a bewitching and masterful film unlike any you've ever seen.
2866,20190039,[Atlantics] can occasionally feel stretched and thin in certain spots; like a cracking medium-length film padded out to feature runtime. Still; that's no matter; because the film's real coup is the victory it scores for greater perspective.
2867,20190039,[It] deftly melds fantasy and romance in a complex portrait of migration.
2868,20190039,I really enjoyed trying to puzzle through this and I was very impressed by the tonal balance that Mati Diop pulls off here.
2869,20190040,The kind of film that derives from a true passion for its subjects; borrowing snippets from some of their most famous films without feeling as though it's simply wallowing in nostalgia
2870,20190040,Coogan and Reilly's portrayals are thoroughly enjoyable and the visual gags work with a pleasant nostalgia; but for such cinematic icons; who were huge stars of their time; overall it feels a bit lightweight and reserved.
2871,20190040,There is plenty to admire in the sedate but moving biopic.
2872,20190040,In 1937; Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are Hollywood stars at the peak of their illustrious comedic powers. But 16 years later they're dining on humble pie.
2873,20190040,Overall; Stan & Ollie is a heartwarming film that takes you back into a time that no longer exists.
2874,20190040,Friendship and comedy make for awkward; hilarious; and ultimately touching bedfellows in Stan and Ollie.
2875,20190040,It's a modest film; but a very good one; and by the end I was quite moved by its valiant belief in decency and in the duo's eternal appeal.
2876,20190040,[T]his one is worthwhile viewing; no matter how lightly it might tread.
2877,20190040,As well as bringing their individual characters to life; Coogan and Reilly lovingly recreate Laurel and Hardy's signature routines.
2878,20190040,It's a film made with an enormous amount of care and affection. And Coogan and O'Reilly don't just perform. They resurrect.
2879,20190040,It's a lovely film if you love movies... There's also a great undercurrent of melancholy.
2880,20190040,The film is more pleasant than edifying; which isn't necessarily a bad thing - it generates a warm sense of reverence for a bygone era of entertainment.
2881,20190041,Wang spins the political out of the personal; preserving and presenting an atrocity with the hope that empathy might be the only way to move forward in this world.
2882,20190041,[Wang] doesn't spoon-feed the wider parallels or telegraph the emotional arcs. That leaves its only big issue; then: how drab this thing looks.
2883,20190041,It is a true horror story.
2884,20190041,This is a story of immense size; told on a personal scale. Also impressive is the access the filmmakers got to people in China; not the easiest place to get access to stories that are critical of the government.
2885,20190041,At a time when we're all fighting in the foothills of similar mountains... One Child Nation is a difficult; yet essential watch.
2886,20190041,A sobering; heartbreaking view of how the Chinese Communist Party has attempted to deal with the country's exploding population.
2887,20190041,As a rule; talking heads do not make for compelling film. But such heads; and such talk.
2888,20190041,"Wang hopes her film will serve to bear witness to the suffering of this shameful period; now being purged from the collective memory with ""Nineteen Eighty-Four""-like efficiency."
2889,20190041,[A] houghtful and sobering dissection of the human toll of government rule.
2890,20190041,[A] powerful documentary...
2891,20190041,What eventually emerges is a peerless portrait of collective trauma - a devastating look at how this law not only sociologically gutted a country but made everyone complicit in the crime.
2892,20190041,Grand atrocities pile atop private heartbreak as this powerful film unfolds.
2893,20190042,Panahi reflects about the liberty of artists and the complicated relationship the people of Iran have with art. [Full review in Spanish]
2894,20190042,An enigmatic and enlightening drama about the resiliency of the feminine spirit.
2895,20190042,A bizarre journey of cultural discovery; immersing themselves in distant languages; customs and beliefs in order to find answers; like reconnecting with roots they didn't know they had lost.
2896,20190042,It's a beautiful and difficult film.
2897,20190042,None of Panahi's usual wit or intelligence is missing; with the focus on outdated male attitudes and the restrictions they place on women in Iran proving to be as incisive as ever.
2898,20190042,As a poem on despair and hopelessness is recited in the background; the film wrestles with some questions...
2899,20190042,Unquestioned patriarchal tradition and desperate responses to its oppressive power are dramatized in the Iranian director Jafar Panahi's sly and defiant metafictional road movie.
2900,20190042,3 Faces is Panahi at his best. The holistic vision of a nation is all at once generous and embracing; alarming and admonitory; bleak and beautiful. Truth is delivered to us by an artist who has suffered it.
2901,20190042,Perhaps a little slacker than some of his previous outings; but Panahi's commitment and courage shine through.
2902,20190042,Provocative without being hectoring.
2903,20190042,This is another example of how Panahi; under the guise of looking inward; is really using cinema to celebrate his connection to others.
2904,20190042,A revelatory meander through Iran's remote villages; with every detour throwing a sidelight on customs and habits shaping everyday life.
2905,20190043,The Last Black Man in San Francisco has an ecstatic; almost hallucinatory beauty reminiscent of Godfrey Reggio's Koyaanisqatsi-style visions. But really; this isn't all that comparable to anything you've seen before.
2906,20190043,This is a delicate and thoughtful film; a fine first directing effort by Joe Talbot; with a story written; in part; by Fails himself based on his own experiences.
2907,20190043,The opening 5 minutes alone are cinematic heaven and we can only hope Talbot and Fails return in years to come to tell more stories.
2908,20190043,The film would be an achievement in terms of character and theme alone; but Talbot shows an awareness for imagery that elevates the script even further (co-written with Rob Richert and co-conceived with Fails).
2909,20190043,In terms of more mainstream Hollywood bromance films; The Last Black Man in San Francisco signals a major departure.
2910,20190043,With storybook-like cinematography to a score that has the longingness of memory and urgency to match the characters onscreen; Joe Talbot shows his appreciation for his home city while giving Jimmie Fails' story its just due.
2911,20190043,This interplay between an almost documentary authenticity and obviously sculpted political allegorical; then between fiction and reality; imbue the film with an odd intensity.
2912,20190043,The whole film lifts and sighs as a lament for vanished birthrights; while coaxing these characters to cherish what they have.
2913,20190043,While Talbot and Fails avoid turning their homespun homesick story into an unwieldy and self-important metaphor for Black American Experience in total; creeping bloat makes itself felt elsewhere.
2914,20190043,The men behind The Last Black Man in San Francisco aren't trying to be cool or sleek. That's the last thing on their minds and probably explains why they do such a fine job of standing out from the crowd.
2915,20190043,It's beautifully filmed and perfectly played. The final shot is as epic as it is heartbreaking.
2916,20190043,It's less of a rallying cry against gentrification than a rumination on the kind of pained acceptance those who suffer its effects must face.
2917,20190044,This wildly improbable yet utterly engrossing tale packed with political connotations is very much recommended.
2918,20190044,What Woman at War succeeds in delivering is an organic; stunning film; thanks to Bergsteinn Björgúlfsson's beautiful cinematography and Erlingsson's considerate direction.
2919,20190044,Highlights not only the rage and ferocity of women's activism; but also its playfulness; generosity and tenderness. It's a delightful film: beautifully shot; full of joyous symbolism; and with a deft central performance from Halldóra Geirharðsdóttir.
2920,20190044,Tense; twisty; and provocative.
2921,20190044,There are running gags... But there is also human compassion among those who help the leading lady along the way.
2922,20190044,WOMAN AT WAR never quite strikes the memorable blow it wants to; but neither does it crash to earth like a pylon sabotaged by Halla.
2923,20190044,The droll absurdity of Nordic cinema acquires an eco-terrorism edge in Woman at War; a movie filled with dualities and one singular performance.
2924,20190044,The film has a bone-dry sense of humour; though the quirk level is turned up just a fraction too high.
2925,20190044,Hollywood would make it a thriller; Erlingsson keeps his politics as teasingly agnostic as his tone; his Icelandic landscape raw; strange; and like everywhere; defended by more Hallas all the time.
2926,20190044,Woman at War takes a sidelong glance at what it means to look; sound and act like a fighter - one hellbent on serving the world's greater good.
2927,20190044,This quirky Icelandic-language dramedy about an unassuming choir conductor from Reykjavik turned notorious eco-terrorist has a prodigious go-for-broke central performance from Halldora Geirharosdottir.
2928,20190044,Strikingly original and immensely entertaining.
2929,20190045,Chained for Life is particularly interested in performance as it relates to people with disabilities; films about them and the able-bodied that play them.
2930,20190045,For all its laudable ambition; however; it eventually becomes a bit bogged down in its own meta-ingenuity.
2931,20190045,He's crafted something wholly unique as it navigates the serious and meaningful as deftly as it does the darkly funny and creepy.
2932,20190045,Although this film raised some very important topics; it continued on its journey as a self-reflexive movie within a movie. Independently; this is an interesting risk to take...
2933,20190045,[A] character driven film that may feel a bit slow but has a decent pay-off for those it will touch and work for in the end.
2934,20190045,Chained is more than a bit of a scathing indictment of Hollywood portrayals of anyone with a disability or who doesn't conform to traditional matinee idol looks...and cinematic mindfuckery to boot.
2935,20190045,Deeply weird without being difficult to follow; Chained also bears traces of David Lynch's The Elephant Man in its DNA - influences that guide Schimberg in a direction that's difficult to predict but fun to follow.
2936,20190045,Schimberg's film is odd; darkly funny and - when it means to be - a little frightening.
2937,20190045,A meaningful; moving; and often quite funny interrogation of beauty in the movies.
2938,20190045,"Anchored by Weixler's and Pearson's natural charm; ""Chained for Life"" stands up as both a quiet ode to the experimental; dreamlike spirit of moviemaking and a seriocomic corrective to sentimentalized sideshow portrayals."
2939,20190045,This low-budget film written and directed by Aaron Schimberg is almost every kind of strange; and yet it has an amiable warmth and an inexhaustible reserve of originality that make it compelling as hell.
2940,20190045,A sharp movie about moviemaking; with welcome surreal touches that are best left unspoiled.
2941,20190046,Lorentzen plunges us into the blood and guts of the city as we careen along inside the ambulance.
2942,20190046,Still; it's a gripping film. The Ochoas are quietly engaging; their night shifts like scenes from a Scorsese urban hellscape.
2943,20190046,Lorentzen communicates his ideas well enough. [Full Review in Spanish]
2944,20190046,Lorentzen's eye is very subtle and elegant that shows the serious healthcare issues in Mexico City. [Full Review in Spanish]
2945,20190046,With a great work of editing and cinematography; the documentary takes us by the hand of the Ochoas for several nights. [Full Review in Spanish]
2946,20190046,Compelling; sobering and deeply humane.
2947,20190046,"""Midnight Family"" is both a compassionate portrait of a working-class family and a frightening ride through a broken healthcare system that risks the lives of both patients and providers like the Ochoa family."
2948,20190046,At 81 minutes; you won't be bored; but don't be surprised if the car ride home finds you questioning how an audition reel for a reality television program earned a theatrical release.
2949,20190046,Were it not for the real tragedy and horror involved; this documentary could almost be filed under the bleakest and often hilarious kind of black comedy.
2950,20190046,Much of the film plays like a madly adrenal action movie.
2951,20190046,Fast paced; action packed. An intimate portrait of the human costs of Mexico's healthcare crisis.
2952,20190046,Mexico City has fewer than 45 official ambulances serving nine million people... Luke Lorentzen's adrenalised documentary focuses on one of the private teams that fill the gap.
2953,20190047,One of Marvel's most layered films; which only gets more enjoyable on the rewatch.
2954,20190047,After all; Captain Marvel is a Marvel Studios film with significant ties to the U.S. military. While it's nominally critical of war; its hands are filthy with government propaganda.
2955,20190047,Marvel's first stand-alone female hero is definitely formidable. And very likely a key component in the next movie.
2956,20190047,Captain Marvel is an enjoyable escapist movie that happens to check all the boxes for a modern progressive audience and delivers humor and action in an easy to watch; slickly-made package that maybe even the fanboys might like.
2957,20190047,Solidly good and very enjoyable. But the film has flickers of greatness; most of which are when the film takes on the form of buddy comedy with Larson paired with Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury. Jackson and Brie have a hilarious rapport.
2958,20190047,Filled with an empowering message and sharp-elbowed clapbacks at the toxic male naysayers of the Marvel fanboy universe; Captain Marvel is just what the MCU and fandom in general needs right now.
2959,20190047,Superhero cinema has lectured us; ad infinitum; on the responsibility that is conferred by extraordinary gifts. Praise be to Larson; for reminding us that they can be bringers of fun.
2960,20190047,Does it work? The short answer is: yes. There's enough to keep both diehard Marvel fans and newcomers engaged.
2961,20190047,The film may be about women breaking their shackles; but the lead actress feels kept in check for much of the picture. Humor winds up being provided by Samuel Jackson's Nick Fury; heart by Lashana Lynch's Maria Rambeau; and pathos by...well; it ain't Larson
2962,20190047,For Marvel there's a new boss in town.
2963,20190047,"Lacking the wit and graphic oomph that sometimes rescues the Marvel franchise from terminal fatigue; ""Captain Marvel"" is yet another origin story for yet another superhero."
2964,20190047,The problem is with the corporate anticulture that controls these productions-and the fandom-targeted demagogy that they're made to fulfill-which responsible casting can't overcome alone.
2965,20190048,Out on home video now is his 103rd film First Love; which utilizes the backdrop of a crime-filled Japanese city to explore how selfishness destroys and a pure heart extends your life.
2966,20190048,A grand guignol. [Full review in Spanish]
2967,20190048,First Love deserves to be in that noble zone of Miike's colossal filmography capable of leaving you cross-eyed in the cerebellum. [Full Review in Spanish]
2968,20190048,An unclassified fusion between the romantic youth thriller; the black comedy; the yakuza cinema; the martial arts cinema and the gore; which finds in the (punctual) gush of creative insolence its best ally. [Full Review in Spanish]
2969,20190048,Expect twists; turns; surprises; violence; love and Miike's wry; knowing wit.
2970,20190048,[T]he twisty; hyper violent First Love is a big winner.
2971,20190048,"""First Love"" resonates because the director and screenwriter Masa Nakamura have more on their minds than just carnage. They bring the story back to its human core; and find the beating heart at the center of all the bloodshed."
2972,20190048,A double-crossing; criss-crossing caper; fatalistic and fun.
2973,20190048,Intricacies of plot come second to the buffet of outlandish characters ranged about the neon-lit underworld - but the film keeps you locked into the mayhem regardless.
2974,20190048,It's bizarre and very unwholesome. But weirdly inspired.
2975,20190048,Imagine if the David Ayer of Street Kings and End of Watch had shot the first half of a gangster movie; then thrown his megaphone to Spaced-age Edgar Wright.
2976,20190048,Yes; it's preposterous and at times hyper-violent; but the tongue is always firmly in its cheek. Until it's cut out.
2977,20190049,Writer/director Issa Lopez's Spanish-language genre mash-up often promises more than it can deliver; but it is helped by a group of compelling youngsters on screen.
2978,20190049,Issa Lopez's dark fantasy is a heartfelt genre film that surpasses all expectations.
2979,20190049,The gritty realism of the street blends with touches of animation and surreal; nightmarish images; magical realism that brings to mind the earliest films of Guillermo Del Toro; in a remarkable tale of traumatic childhood.
2980,20190049,Tigers Are Not Afraid is absolutely; heartbreakingly beautiful and darkly whimsical; a twisted; real world fairytale that grabs the audience and doesn't let them go until the very end.
2981,20190049,There is a beguiling delicacy and precision about López's work that hits you almost immediately.
2982,20190049,Horror cinema that goes to places not yet explored. The terrors of reality filtered through fantasy that feels relevant and punches a lot of guts. [Full review in Spanish].
2983,20190049,Tigers Are Not Afraid may be imperfect; but you can feel the passion and creativity of its filmmaker in every decision. She's fearless.
2984,20190049,It gets its claws into you; and won't let go.
2985,20190049,It conveys the sense of destruction that's come with all the narco trafficking; but it also has this really beautiful fantasy element that's woven throughout.
2986,20190049,"Blending the often frightening surrealism of a child's wild imagination with the blood-splattered realism of the drug cartels; ""Tigers Are Not Afraid"" is a highly original horror story made for these times."
2987,20190049,Call it Buñuel meets Blumhouse; a film that is flawed but so full of ideas that it doesn't matter.
2988,20190049,López elicits solid performances from the young actors; and her vision is clear and uncompromising.
2989,20190050,A wonderfully human portrait of life on the bottom rung.
2990,20190050,director Lila Avilés shines a light on the life of a woman who crosses paths with many but is seen by few.
2991,20190050,"""The Chambermaid"" is at its best and worst when focusing on the routines of hotel staff; though more so the former than the latter."
2992,20190050,Engrossing; and in a country where most hotels have chambermaids that look just like Evelia; occasionally moving and often troubling.
2993,20190050,Inevitable comparisons to Roma will be unfair; but Mexico put The Chambermaid in that position by selecting it as their Oscar submission.
2994,20190050,There are perhaps two ways you can read the conclusion to Eve's story; although which one you choose may depend on your own personal outlook on life.
2995,20190050,"How the film counters its protagonist's ambitions makes for an alternately bleak and reverent experience; leaving us with an understanding of what ""women's work"" really means."
2996,20190050,[An] intimate and enlightening portrait. [Full review in Spanish]
2997,20190050,As modest as its heroine. [Full Review in Spanish]
2998,20190050,The lack of any social theme for the purposes of vulgar didactism maintains one's interest in The Chambermaid. [Full review in Spanish]
2999,20190050,A transcendent film. [Full review in Spanish]
3000,20190050,There is something fascinating in the struggle of this woman faced with the impersonality of the human condition. [Full Review in Spanish]
3001,20190051,The flowing; often downright poetic dialogue still rolls off the screen and into your ears like beautifully profane music.
3002,20190051,"The term ""fan service"" is often used as a cudgel against artists who may or may not be pandering to their loyal audiences; but the Deadwood movie feels like an ideal version of that concept."
3003,20190051,[David] Milch's gift for raw frontier poetry; with Shakespearean soliloquies filtered through X-rated doggerel; is as entertaining as ever in a violent yet appropriately elegiac (and oh-so-satisfying) two-hour farewell.
3004,20190051,It's a story for the ages and one that finally gets the fitting ending it deserves.
3005,20190051,[I]f the worst one can say is that the Deadwood movie feels more like an encore than a send-off; that's far from the worst position to be in.
3006,20190051,The Deadwood movie is a deeply-satisfying and tightly-written coda to one of the best TV series ever.
3007,20190051,This movie is a gift; and a fond farewell. I love Milch's writing; his loquacious waterfall.
3008,20190051,It's not much of a conclusion to the story of Deadwood; but it brings the experience of it; as well as the arcs of its two main characters to resting places that feel as perfect as they can.
3009,20190051,It's Malcomson who runs away with Deadwood: The Movie.
3010,20190051,By the standards of Deadwood itself; the movie may not add much to the conversation. But by the standards of a revival; it's done exactly what it should.
3011,20190051,Deadwood is a story; not of this century; but also not quite out of the past.
3012,20190051,"""Deadwood"" movie is a pleasing reunion; giving the characters and Milch the kind of ending this groundbreaking series always deserved."
3013,20190052,Playing out as if Michael Curtiz's Casablanca and Michelangelo Antonioni's The Passenger had been re-imagined by Franz Kafka; this adaptation of Anna Seghers's 1942 novel strikingly relocates the action to a millennial Marseilles.
3014,20190052,"Inhabiting a realm between the past and present; Europe and America; and also cinema and literature; [Petzold's characters] are; in Hannah Arendt's phrase; ""living ghosts among the ruins of our times."""
3015,20190052,Transit captures the tragedy of uncertainty in astonishingly heartbreaking ways.
3016,20190052,For a film based around a lie; Transit has a strong narrative foundation; however; the indistinguishable time period; along with other questionable directorial choices; play too melodramatic to be memorable.
3017,20190052,An interesting; if not completely satisfying; drama.
3018,20190052,Lifting the story out of context in this way works in Petzold's favor; as Transit exists as neither a museum piece nor a harrowing depiction of the current refugee crisis; but rather a literary tale of displacement; identity; and seeking.
3019,20190052,[A] bold adaptation.
3020,20190052,These two actors mesh well together; effortlessly generating a compelling chemistry borne of a shared sense of unease and immediacy.
3021,20190052,Christian Petzold's white-hot existentialist noir Transit is perhaps the best World War II film since Paul Verhoeven's Black Book; even if it hinges on a suspension of disbelief that'll be too far a stretch for some.
3022,20190052,Transit is a thrilling and unsettling film that tangibly recreates a nightmare of displacement and uncertainty; but in such a way that could appeal to a broader audience.
3023,20190052,Phenomenal as an intellectual exercise; a piece of storytelling; a dive into a mysterious; dream-like world; and as a Kafkaesque character drama.
3024,20190052,Transit is most powerful emotionally during sequences where the main character puts his own grief and confusion on hold to look after a small boy in need of a substitute dad.
3025,20190053,Even at its most dire; Mickey and the Bear is tinged with an almost holy hope for all involved; a rare and remarkable feat to pull off so well for a first-time director indeed.
3026,20190053,Take notice of director Annabelle Attanasio's feature film debut.
3027,20190053,Writer/director Annabelle Attanasio... in her debut feature; shows a mature handling of interpersonal dynamics.
3028,20190053,When Mickey is finally pushed to action; it's a relief; suffusing Mickey and the Bear with a feeling of hope amid the darkness and transforming a good film into a great one.
3029,20190053,A character study pulled off through superb performances.
3030,20190053,Mickey; the heroine of this thoughtful coming-of-age drama; is not your usual Midwest teenager. When she surreptitiously dips into her father's wallet; it's to put money in rather than take it out.
3031,20190053,An almost perfectly realized drama that feels as if it was time-warped in from 40 or 50 years ago; when people still wanted to see movies about people living in the actual world.
3032,20190053,Small but deeply felt.
3033,20190053,The best thing one can say about Attanasio's approach to this material... is that she understands how complicated people's lives are when on the surface their issues might seem cut-and-dried.
3034,20190053,Through these complicated dynamics; Morrone navigates her character's many highs and lows with a touching sense of authenticity.
3035,20190053,"Every shot in ""Mickey and the Bear"" is scrupulously judged but never overworked or fussy; resulting in a movie that is as artful as it is unforced."
3036,20190053,"""Mickey and the Bear"" unfolds languidly; allowing tension to build slowly; intimately."
3037,20190054,Like Ad Astra; the film concentrates on relationships and emotional states as much as on outward action. Unlike Ad Astra; Midnight Traveler tells a story that actually happened.
3038,20190054,...an unsettling sign of the times
3039,20190054,Viewers of Fazili's rewarding film may be comparatively few; but Midnight Traveller offers an indelible record of how inhumanity continues to flourish in the early 21st century.
3040,20190054,The combination of perspectives paints a vivid and hopeful portrait of a family; as well as an indictment of the refugee crisis.
3041,20190054,This is a first-person account of statelessness made with an eye for striking scenes -- not something that could have been put together by anyone who cribbed material from publicly available news sources.
3042,20190054,A film that finds poignant family moments even in the darkest depths of the ongoing refugee crisis.
3043,20190054,"In showing such a personal; unmeditated view of the global migration crisis through one family's story; ""Midnight Traveler"" is a timely; essential film."
3044,20190054,Midnight Traveler is an unforgettable answer to the refugee question.
3045,20190054,A powerful; personal piece of work.
3046,20190054,A film that should be required viewing for anyone seeking to enter the debate on the refugee crisis; not as polemic but as a digital box of surprises.
3047,20190054,It is a suspenseful adventure story; a psychological profile of a family on the run and; most poignantly; an intimate portrait of two young children adopting adult behaviours as a matter of survival.
3048,20190054,Shot entirely on iPhones; the Afghan director's charming and moving documentary charts his three-year flight with his young family from Tajikistan; where they had failed to find asylum; 3;500 miles to the west.
3049,20190055,Her official final work; a straightforward and yet endlessly fascinating look at her career.
3050,20190055,If all my professors were as knowledgeable; as caring; and as fun as Agnès Varda; I wouldn't have skipped class so often.
3051,20190055,Her final movie can be taken as an act of generosity. She had things to tell us.
3052,20190055,The film is more a lesson on craft and doing things your own way than anything; and Varda gets fascinatingly specific.
3053,20190055,Varda by Agnes doesn't just make you wish that it was longer; but that it was possible to see every single image Agnes Varda ever put to film.
3054,20190055,It has interesting moments; but long stretches play like a TED talk Varda did which covers much of the same ground. While she is a wonderful filmmaker - which bits of this film get across - I think you'd be better watching one of Varda's many other films.
3055,20190055,"One of the treats of ""Varda by Agnès"" is seeing the director in photos and on-set footage over the years; forever self-possessed; always questing."
3056,20190055,This final film acts as a perfect button to a legendary life in art; and it's also a launchpad to viewers who want to go back and explore her groundbreaking contributions to the cinema.
3057,20190055,"""Varda by Agnès"" may be a summing up from one end of a long; beautiful life in art. But it has the lightness; curiosity and spirit of a first film; and that tells us who Varda the artist was too: ever inspired; ever creating; ever eager to share."
3058,20190055,This is a wonderful movie -- one of my favorites of the year... Even if you haven't seen any of her movies; it's like meeting an old friend.
3059,20190055,It's a self-portrait; a film history lesson; a remembrance of things past; a perfect coda to her career; a moving scrapbook and a masterclass that now doubles as a memento mori.
3060,20190055,"""Varda by Agnès"" provides an essential look inside the creative mind. It's not often that filmmakers reveal themselves so openly while looking back over their careers; and it's a treat when they do."
3061,20190056,Hail Satan? has plenty of good points to make; like comparing the 80's and 90's witch hunts that got metalheads and goth kids disenfranchised and sent the West Memphis three to jail...
3062,20190056,Lane keeps her documentary light with an irreverent tone that very clearly understands the trolling that the Satanic Temple is engaging in.
3063,20190056,Lane's predisposition toward the archival makes it possible for an even greater number of individuals to engage with TST's message of the dangers of tacitly allowing church and state to intermingle.
3064,20190056,[A] frequently hilarious documentary that chronicles the history of The Satanic Temple.
3065,20190056,This entertaining doco does not pitch the Temple's oddball leadership group as heroes in any way; but it is fascinating to see how much a bunch of self-confessed trolls and trouble magnets can get done when they put their mind to it.
3066,20190056,It's an underdog story in the most traditional sense as we watch the Temple of Satan begin to attract more and more members with their message of tolerance and empathy; all the while insisting that America honor the intentions of its Founding Fathers.
3067,20190056,Director Penny Lane frames her smart; level-headed documentary as a discussion about the Satanic Temple and its fight for religious equality.
3068,20190056,[A] funny; light-hearted documentary...
3069,20190056,Way to go! Is membership of this group still open?
3070,20190056,A very witty; smart; eye-opening and entertaining documentary.
3071,20190056,This engrossing documentary illuminates numerous facets of an outre circus with a serious purpose.
3072,20190056,The movie provides valuable food for thought about the role of religion in American society.
3073,20190057,Ready or Not is remarkably successful at hitting its own sweet spot for such a modest movie.
3074,20190057,Not many movies can have you laughing at one minute & biting your nails at another Ready Or Not does. It is the perfect combination of horror & humor. A wild & fun ride!
3075,20190057,A madcap cat-and-mouse game that's exhilaratingly fun...and offers a darkly funny and satirical take on just how ridiculous the rich really are.
3076,20190057,Shamelessly entertaining; but very stupid.
3077,20190057,It was crazy... I enjoyed this.
3078,20190057,It was a good theater-going experience.
3079,20190057,There's no attempt to be seriously disturbing; or to offer us anything more than a macabre good time. Still; on that level the film delivers.
3080,20190057,Even by its own humble standards the plot is poorly worked out (a few lame attempts at social commentary criticising the rich are feeble in the extreme) and the dialogue is wretched.
3081,20190057,[Samara Weaving] faces an uphill slog; hampered by a creaky plot; cookie-cutter supporting characters and plodding direction.
3082,20190057,It's never easy creating something fresh within the well-worn horror genre but Ready or Not deserves praise for its cool concept.
3083,20190057,It's wildly entertaining and at a tight 90 minutes; it crackles with energy; never letting your attention waver.
3084,20190057,"Weaving comes alive as a hilarious and deeply macabre play on the ""final girl"" archetype; and it's nothing short of cathartic to cheer her on and echo the rage that quickly consumes and empowers her."
3085,20190058,Instead it capitalises on the authority with which she talks about her craft and the life experience and history that has informed it to provide an illuminating personal insight into her radical body of work.
3086,20190058,Timothy Greenfield-Sanders's documentary portrait of the Nobel-winning author is a fluent introduction to her work; but its main attraction is the sense it gives you of being in her company.
3087,20190058,[Morrison's] novels managed to catch the African-American experience better perhaps than anyone has before or since; and to listen to her talk about her craft here is a joy.
3088,20190058,The film is a bit too long but if you have read the books it will make you want to reread them; and if you haven't you will want to.
3089,20190058,Overall; The Pieces I Am is a celebratory; empowering and vivacious documentary; allowing audiences to bask in the company of the woman behind the legacy.
3090,20190058,A documentary that brims with love and admiration for Morrison's work and life.
3091,20190058,[W]hen it's over; you feel like a beloved friend has left the room.
3092,20190058,The tone is generally celebratory and; given Morrison's extraordinary impact on American letters; deservedly so.
3093,20190058,Coming less than a year after her death; Timothy Greenfield-Sanders' film can't help being an elegy - but a celebration; too; of a woman acutely of her times and always a step ahead of them.
3094,20190058,For all the intellectual content; the most rewarding part of this documentary is the presence of Morrison herself - her infectious laugh; her famous carrot cake; her joyful love of parties.
3095,20190058,Makes you want to read the books; so full success on that front.
3096,20190058,This documentary is a potent commercial for the books themselves.
3097,20190059,If anything; it's best to experience Ad Astra without trying to be active in the story. Try too hard to look back and the past will just become a cosmic joke.
3098,20190059,[T]he best way to experience Ad Astra; is to let it wash over you; allow its masterful use of light and sound to enhance an already incredible piece of writing and a tremendous performance from Pitt.
3099,20190059,What could have been a great sci-fi movie was bogged down with dialogue and no real story. It is extremely boring and not worth a watch. Skip this one.
3100,20190059,Brad Pitt is a movie star; and he uses every bit of his star DNA to carry Ad Astra. It's the performance of his career.
3101,20190059,The special effects are seamless while the entire production design on the outer space sequences has a sense of realism and lived-in feel to it.
3102,20190059,James Gray's Ad Astra is an inwards journey about the necessity to feel things.
3103,20190059,Gray has a gift for shrinking massive set pieces and enlarging private dramas.
3104,20190059,The film's geography takes us on a cross-solar system journey but the real trajectory is deep into the human experience - finding meaning in life and coming to grips with being left behind.
3105,20190059,To lavish too much praise on Mr. Pitt's performance would be to somehow suggest he isn't already among the best actors on screen. He is.
3106,20190059,In a mesmerizing; minimalist performance; Pitt forms the gravitational center of a film that takes its place in the firmament of science fiction films by fearlessly quoting classics of the genre (as well as those outside it).
3107,20190059,This is slow; obtuse filmmaking with little emotional connection.
3108,20190059,For most of its running time; Ad Astra amounts to a rather somber and sterile two-hour orbit.
3109,20190060,Combines the nightmare paganism of The Wicker Man with the stately; painterly elegance of The Shining.
3110,20190060,While it may frustrate some viewers; and present an absolute affront to the tastes of others; for the discerning fan of screen horror it is an absolute must-see.
3111,20190060,Aster proves what a formally accomplished director he is; and how he totally understands that the medium is all about aesthetic and spectacle.
3112,20190060,A little too serious; not campy enough.
3113,20190060,I didn't enjoy watching it; but it had its validity.
3114,20190060,Midsommar is an exquisitely visceral cinematic experience that leaves you both physically and emotionally exhausted as the credits begin to wash over you.
3115,20190060,"""Midsommar"" isn't just a great horror movie... It is also one of the best movies ever made about living with mental illness."
3116,20190060,Midsommar mostly takes place in Sweden; but at its core is a particularly American sense of rootlessness.
3117,20190060,Even more than Hereditary; Midsommar lives on the edge where horror meets absurdity; prompting the kind of laughter that comes from not knowing how else to respond.
3118,20190060,I was never; even for one second; feeling the length... I found it so unsettling and sinister. At moments it was a little uneven; but it's so watchable and gets under your skin in a really creepy way.
3119,20190060,Midsommar is a waking nightmare and I mean that in the best possible way.
3120,20190060,After a while; an unproductive restlessness sets in as you wait for the characters to matter as much as the silky moves and painstaking details. Horror
3121,20190061,As gloriously euphoric as the finest of Bruce's anthems.
3122,20190061,A feel-good film told with broad-strokes buoyed by a raft of Springsteen songs and honest performances by its cast.
3123,20190061,It works; it just can't live up to the nostalgic value of its music. Still a good watch.
3124,20190061,Occasionally blinded by its own big heart but is still sweet and affecting.
3125,20190061,It's a feel-good movie with a good message and lot of heart.
3126,20190061,The heart is really what got me.
3127,20190061,Blinded by the Light at its very best; captures the experience of being a fan; the pure exhilaration of it; and the sense of your vision opening out to vistas beyond your horizon.
3128,20190061,"""Blinded by the Light"" represents such a sweet; easy-to-relate-to story that it deserves to be seen; at the least; by anyone who has shown a little faith that there's magic in the arts -- either in music; or a darkened theater."
3129,20190061,Even when it feels as if we've seen this movie before; we've never seen it set to the sounds of the Boss; and we've never seen it from the point of view of this particular terrific kid and his family.
3130,20190061,Despite its predictability; it conveys what it's like to be enraptured by a rock idol.
3131,20190061,The deliberately amateurish style of the musical numbers is supposed to engender spontaneity but too often looks merely cack-handed. Nonetheless; you come out on a high. Springsteen fever proves to be contagious.
3132,20190061,Most of the film's emotional weight is undermined by cheesy sing-alongs with the lyrics visualized in such a garish way that the supposed thematic significance bashes the audience in the head.
3133,20190062,The Heiresses is a quiet and spare lesbian drama. It will resonate with anyone who has settled into their ways and suddenly finds themselves having to reinvent their life.
3134,20190062,Slow and quiet throughout; like the two lead ladies; there is a kind of fading elegance to it. Rough around the edges; wrinkled; but totally involving.
3135,20190062,In telling a personal story The Heiresses; then; is also very much a political tale. It's a terrifically accomplished debut full of humour and deep tenderness...
3136,20190062,Marcelo Martinessi's The Heiresses is a quietly powerful fable of hidden desires; long-lost escapades and a really deceptive look into how gender roles are devised in traditional films about older people.
3137,20190062,Directed with subtlety and a genuine affection for its protagonist; the film unfolds like a gentle dance; hitting notes of joy and regret without heavy-handed dramatics.
3138,20190062,With so many delicate moments; the women's performances; from theater actors and many non actors too; all had time to craft their characters.
3139,20190062,By the end of the film; the audience feels like it knows his heroine at almost precisely the same time she has gotten to know herself. It's a minor kind of magic.
3140,20190062,But if some questions remain unanswered; Brun's performance provides much of the clarity we need.
3141,20190062,Sorry; no backstory; no flashbacks. Just Brun's masterful performance as a mask that is starting to crack.
3142,20190062,It's a small story; but the points it makes about the corrosion wrought by class distinctions and the prejudices attached to them give it a dimension that will resonate wherever you happen to live.
3143,20190062,A really well-acted character study.
3144,20190062,[A] crafty debut feature.
3145,20190063,Despite my inability to understand some of the dialog ; and the fact that I'm not a fan of this kind of music; I enjoyed the film. It is well written and acted. Director Tom Harper also helmed another of my favorite 2019 films; 'The Aeronauts.'
3146,20190063,f any film of the recent barrage of aspiring pop star movies have any semblance of truth; this film subverts the expectations of dreamers around the world by saying the only way to make a change is to look inward.
3147,20190063,The performances feel genuine and Jack Arnold's subtle score is used intelligently enough to complement the peaks and troughs of the drama; rather than leading us by the hand.
3148,20190063,The lead performances carry the film; and the soundtrack is sure to sell well. With some more plot discipline; though; it's hard to shake the feeling WILD ROSE couldn't have been so much more.
3149,20190063,"""Wild Rose"" truly works because its relatively unknown star; Jessie Buckley; happens to be blessed with extraordinary singing and acting gifts."
3150,20190063,Wild Rose is never particularly surprising; but it's a familiar story renewed in a satisfyingly female-focused way.
3151,20190063,Buckley... confirms that she is a specialist in the untamed.
3152,20190063,"In ""Wild Rose;"" that heartbreak can - and does - become something beautiful."
3153,20190063,Buckley's unusually unguarded expressions give viewers entry into her character's every thought.
3154,20190063,When the story shifts to Nashville; the screenplay by Nicole Taylor takes some sharp and insightful turns...
3155,20190063,...perhaps a little too tidily by the end; Wild Rose nonetheless feels authentic.
3156,20190063,"""Wild Rose"" is singing a different tune. Just don't be surprised when it winds up getting stuck in your head."
3157,20190064,As a whole the 'Up' series is truly an extraordinary cinematic accomplishment...As befits the age of the principals; this installment feels more leisurely and autumnal than earlier ones; but that certainly doesn't make it any less affecting.
3158,20190064,Though no one perspective is universal; 63 Up's remains admirably considered; sweeping; and reflective; which is all just as it should be. It's less an elegy than an ode to life.
3159,20190064,There can never be an unimportant chapter in the lives of real human beings. For that reason; the new 63 Up demands watching just as much as any of the previous eight.
3160,20190064,With 63 Up; the quiet wonder of simply executing such a project reigns -- the potentially mundane resonates profoundly when watching a human life arc or veer before your eyes.
3161,20190064,In the span of a minute; we see a hopeful young boy grow into a disaffected young man; then into a mellowed older man. It's impossible not think of ourselves; our parents and our children; and how quickly life happens to us.
3162,20190064,With each installment; and each passing seven-year period; I find myself growing more attached to these people; and less prepared to say goodbye.
3163,20190064,Cherish 63 Up; like you cherish life.
3164,20190064,"The participants in Michael Apted's ongoing social experiment; which began with ""Seven Up!"" in 1964 and has become increasingly fascinating; have reached the age where they can see the approaching exit sign in their lives."
3165,20190064,This film and its predecessors are a mirror to all.
3166,20190064,At first glance; 21 Up played as somewhat of a novelty. That was over forty years ago. Today; it stands as one of cinema's greatest achievements; a use of the medium that's at once blatantly logical and profoundly affecting.
3167,20190064,There is a touching universality to these life stories; which at this point have a lulling near-sameness...
3168,20190064,Watching 63 Up as a stand-alone endeavor may not seem remarkable. In fact; it may even be a little boring. But watching it as part of the larger picture imbues it with immediacy and power.
3169,20190065,Watching Too Late to Die Young felt like being carried by a gentle stream. It has a dreamlike; even-keeled quality one doesn't find in many Hollywood movies.
3170,20190065,A tender portrait of children deserting their fidelity to the optimism in which they can no longer believe.
3171,20190065,I love this perfectly lovely little movie.
3172,20190065,Dominga Sotomayor returns to the nostalgia of childhood and finds space; even; for reverie and convention. [Full Review in Spanish]
3173,20190065,Visually; Castillo's hazy; nostalgic look back at this key period in the country's recent history is akin to watching events as seen through a series of washed out Polaroid pictures.
3174,20190065,A coming-of-age and slice-of-life drama set in Chile.
3175,20190065,Castillo's talent for spiritually attuned atmospherics could be her USP among Chile's current crop of directors with idiosyncratic slants on their country's recent past.
3176,20190065,An intimate; human-focused film with broad allegorical potential.
3177,20190065,Sotomayor approaches her characters and their problems with subtlety and tact; and is more interested in reading their glances and gestures than in putting words in their mouths.
3178,20190065,"""Too Late to Die Young"" doesn't pretend to show us everything; which makes it all the more remarkable just how much it sees."
3179,20190065,"""Too Late to Die Young"" almost has a timeless quality to it; a period unencumbered by outdated tech and dusty cultural references. But this dreamy world would not exist without the outside forces that go unmentioned."
3180,20190065,For better and worse (mostly better); Too Late To Die Young is a mood movie; situated on an emotional precipice.
3181,20190066,A glorious pop spectacle that is both enormously entertaining - even if you're not a particular fan of Beyoncé's; as I'm not - and hugely important.
3182,20190066,Her performance celebrated HBCUs; feminism; activism and the African-American community.
3183,20190066,She of course looks amazing.
3184,20190066,This show represented something different; as it was more in tune with her roots than what a mostly white audience at the music festival in California could begin to understand.
3185,20190066,Too many people still treat African American culture with willful amnesia or purposeful neglect. This kind of affirmation and condensed schooling is just what we need to cut through the nonsense.
3186,20190066,The behind-the-scenes stuff is indeed fascinating; but no match for the revelatory experience of Beyonce's performance itself; which lives up to everything you may have heard.
3187,20190066,This revelatory; incredible; inspiring documentary gives you both a front-row pass to watch every hit song and backstage access to see how its musical; logistical and philosophical foundations all came together in perfect harmony.
3188,20190066,Call it contradictory or call it complexity; but it's all part of what makes Beyoncé so fascinating.
3189,20190066,Non-Beylievers should check out Homecoming; too: it's unabashedly indulgent at nearly two-and-a-half hours; but conveys a more tactile; communal sense of her star magnetism than you might glean from her mirror-sheen recordings.
3190,20190066,At the glittering centre of it all is Beyoncé herself: master maker of her own modern myth; an uber-perfectionist capitalist surveying her multimedia empire.
3191,20190066,Homecoming is not your standard concert film by any stretch.
3192,20190066,Beyoncé crafted the masterpiece with black pride and the spirit of historically black colleges and universities.
3193,20190067,The film is not a visual spectacle... but it is the message that possesses the true power and purpose that Ozon evidently wishes to transmit. [Full Review in Spanish]
3194,20190067,It treats brittle facts with visual delicacy and suggestions that; although we do not see them; are forceful; unforgettable and graceless. [Full review in Spanish]
3195,20190067,There's a power to By the Grace of God that could have been less overt -- I'm looking at you; Spotlight poster in the background of one scene -- but it by and large sticks the landing.
3196,20190067,Ozon never plays the sentimental card and while the abuse suffered by the men is no doubt horrific; the details of their inner lives remain elusive.
3197,20190067,Mutating into a documentary-style approach; Ozon has a talented cast helping him stabilize the narrative disproportion whenever the film goes up and down in tone.
3198,20190067,Populate these environments with a group of terrific performances; and it makes for a welcoming-yet-unforgiving look into an issue that should be understood by as many people as possible.
3199,20190067,Not Ozon's most assured piece of storytelling; but a hard film to shake.
3200,20190067,It's strong material; and apt to infuse the viewer with righteous ire.
3201,20190067,"""By the Grace of God"" begins to spin its wheels; with unnecessary scenes that give color to the events; when we're more interested in the grand movements."
3202,20190067,The film gathers momentum and shading as it goes.
3203,20190067,One is prone to expect excess in a film by François Ozon; [but he] wisely opts to frame the fact-based events as a straightforward crime drama.
3204,20190067,Ozon was wise to translate the story into fiction. In their rawness and their sense of intimacy; the family scenes ferret out the emotional truths behind the bald and bitter facts.
3205,20190068,Though it may be on the nose at times; Little Woods is a tense and emotional look at the political issues we're arguing about today that are affecting people's lives.
3206,20190068,The film may not look impressive; but I am impressed by how [writer-director Nia] DaCosta introduces complications into this already complicated story without straining for effect.
3207,20190068,A predictable narrative given rich contours...
3208,20190068,This is a film of high tension about two sisters living on the edge of ruin in the farthest northern reaches of North Dakota. One slip up and they could end up homeless; or in jail. The only things they have to rely on are their wits and each other.
3209,20190068,[Tessa] Thompson's forceful; charismatic performance brings life to what could have been a relentlessly grim film; but it also unbalances the drama somewhat.
3210,20190068,DaCosta; Thompson; and James have created something tense and timely and empathetic in Little Woods; further expanding the Western genre and adding another slice of American life to it.
3211,20190068,This startlingly accomplished debut feature by Nia DaCosta has the eyes and ears of a documentary-the opioid crisis is everywhere; the nearest hospital is far away-but the heart of a drama; and a stirring one.
3212,20190068,[DaCosta] intuitively reveals a deeper dimension to both of her heroines by taking an extra beat at the beginning or end of scenes to observe their faces when no one else is watching.
3213,20190068,If this is [DaCosta's] starting line; imagine what she'll be able to do once she hits her stride.
3214,20190068,It's a testament to the strength of Thompson's performance; and DaCosta's control of tone and action; that for all the bleakness of this world; we keep watching.
3215,20190068,It's the kind of scenario we've often seen on screen; but the ambience is new and precisely evoked as a world of cruel contrasts.
3216,20190068,A taut and affecting thriller.
3217,20190069,Dario Grandinetti's riveting performance as the vaguely menacing yet bureaucratic Claudio is a reminder that repulsive or unfathomable characters can be as fascinating as likable ones.
3218,20190069,Surviving the initial two scenes of this disturbing and excellent movie is no easy task. [Full Review in Spanish]
3219,20190069,A damning political satire thriller set in 1975 Argentina before the coup of the military junta.
3220,20190069,Set in Argentina a year before the military coup of 1976 that turned the country into a torture chamber; it is a searing portrait of the middle-class complacency that relied on.
3221,20190069,Director Benjamin Naishtat throws us into a tizzy and then keeps us guessing; when he will lower the cinematic boom.
3222,20190069,Rojo pulsates both with the motif of blood and the subtly indelible image of a solar eclipse; when an orb blots out the sun; obscuring all but its deep red edges.
3223,20190069,A disquieting parable of iniquity.
3224,20190069,Mad? Possibly. Watchable? Definitely.
3225,20190069,It's all about a society manoeuvring to stay at the dinner table while getting its unsavoury elements thrown out; and finding ways to stop them ever coming back.
3226,20190069,Embrace this little masterpiece before it disappears.
3227,20190069,It's powerful material; deftly delivered.
3228,20190069,Deadpan [and] very funny even though you feel uncomfortable laughing.
3229,20190070,The director narrates with notable care the implications derived from being parents of some pornographers. [Full Review in Spanish]
3230,20190070,An intimate and fascinating documentary that casts a light on the history and the struggles of the queer community in American society. [Full Review in Spanish]
3231,20190070,Circus of Books is a whirlwind of a story; and an absolute triumph of a film.
3232,20190070,"If you hear ""mom and pop gay porn store"" and don't immediately send Jerry Falwell a check; watch Circus of Books. It's genuinely moving and impeccably made."
3233,20190070,An interesting story about not only gay life in America and the story of a small business; but also what's going on in [a] family that runs this extremely unusual small business.
3234,20190070,Circus of Books is essential viewing-a raw; often hilarious; moving story about a family working in the background of a marginalized culture.
3235,20190070,People can indeed live at war with themselves and not know it. Here's a case of great things happening once peace is declared.
3236,20190070,Both Circus of Books locations have since closed; but this documentary is a necessary; if incomplete; homage to their influence.
3237,20190070,The sense of closure is satisfying; but it's missing a charge.
3238,20190070,This is a great little L.A. story. It's a great slice of life into a very specific community.
3239,20190070,Circus of Books is the story of an American family who wandered into the eye of history; and a virtuoso example of how to make a movie both very big and very small at once.
3240,20190070,Circus of Books is a triumph of filmmaking in the way it covers such a range of topics so seamlessly: LGBTQ history; pornography; religion; obscenity law; media; AIDS; coming out; parenthood; and more.
3241,20190071,Lelio creates a luminous new version although one can't help but feel they have seen this before. [Full review in Spanish]
3242,20190071,Once her dating life blossoms after meeting Arnold; played by John Turturro; the film constantly weaves in and out losing it's cohesiveness.
3243,20190071,Moore's performance in Gloria Bell is Oscar worthy and she is surrounded by a solid group of actors who help her to shine.
3244,20190071,Bringing a free-flowing and European cinematic style to tell the story of a modern American woman; Gloria Bell will have you rooting and swooning for its title character as she tries to be the auteur of her own biopic.
3245,20190071,Best musical of the year. Julianne Moore in a take no prisoners transformative rebel middle age makeover. And with lots of self-celebratory; breathlessly expressive emancipation in this somewhat feminist musical too.
3246,20190071,Julianne Moore truly is one of the greatest of all time; and it's a delight to watch her bring her peppy gravitas to a role that many would have seen fit to lean on trope to portray.
3247,20190071,The thumping heart of all of it is Moore; whose magnetically watchable; fully inhabited; offhandedly sexy performance makes Gloria Bell's reflective longueurs shimmer...
3248,20190071,There are low moments; flat moments and unconvincing moments - but Gloria deserves to be protected at all costs.
3249,20190071,Whether she's dealing with conflicts at work; doing laugh therapy sessions; or smoking weed on the floor of her apartment while the Californian sunlight slants through the window; this is a Bell that chimes.
3250,20190071,The result isn't better than the 2013 original but it's just as good.
3251,20190071,Gloria Bell is somewhat exhausting - both unbearably intimate and at a constant remove - but it is endlessly pulled back into focus by Moore.
3252,20190071,[Julianne Moore] is always terrific; but she gives an especially terrific; well-rounded performance here. It's nuanced; vulnerable; strong; funny; emotionally rich and textured.
3253,20190072,...by focusing on the individuals involved; and laying out a compelling moral vision; Dark Waters also works as a powerful metaphor for those cases when persistence and compassion have pushed society forward.
3254,20190072,Haynes has made a whistleblower drama for our time; when corporate corruption has spread and even those of who believe in justice are beginning to have doubts.
3255,20190072,Sometimes; sometimes; Herculean effort does pay off...an extremely well-told story.
3256,20190072,Dark Waters is as gripping as it is terrifying; and it'll claw into your consciousness in the same way that poisonous forever chemicals have claimed squatter's rights in your body.
3257,20190072,A friendly courtoom drama that spends too many time outside of court and inside Ruffalo's character. Still pretty decent after that. [Full review in Spanish].
3258,20190072,Dark Waters value is made manifest in the way it mixes the tender with the anxious; presenting rousing interrogation of the contemporary world that feels too angry to ignore.
3259,20190072,The Bilotts make compelling viewing; straight arrows losing the scales from their eyes.
3260,20190072,A movie that works marvellously well within its own generic terms...
3261,20190072,True to its title; this is a murky pool of a movie; and Mark Ruffalo is the man on the bank; poking its surface with a stick.
3262,20190072,In Dark Waters; [Todd Haynes] bathes his audience in pure terror like very few other directors could.
3263,20190072,The subject deserved better.
3264,20190072,The groundswell of dogged determination propelling this environmental thriller is so powerful that it deals effortlessly with the knotty tangle of facts packed into its plot. Much of this is down to the film's star and initiator; Mark Ruffalo.
3265,20190073,An eloquent and provocative drama.
3266,20190073,The struggles of the trans community are featured in the film by Flavio Alves that manages to deliver a powerful message without breaking new ground.
3267,20190073,Alves seriously explores the trials and tribulations of a young Mexican trans woman's hopes and aspirations in a New York City that doesn't always acknowledge her agenda...
3268,20190073,Performances are down-to-earth; mixing bright sarcasm and camaraderie with darkly pointed observations. [Carlie] Guevara is a likeable central character; simply trying to live truthfully with her friends and family.
3269,20190073,Strives for an authentic portrayal of what it's like to be trans and an immigrant in New York today.
3270,20190073,It's thought provoking about judgements we make and first time writer/director Flavio Alves manages for the most part to walk that fine line between melodrama and preaching.
3271,20190073,Alves and Guevara may be making a quiet film about the mistreatment of trans people in America; but their voices are loud and demand to be heard.
3272,20190073,The type of film that forces the audience to feel; rather than just demanding that they should.
3273,20190073,Compelling performances bolster a lackluster script that plays too hard for shock value. Alves' film is worth a watch for cisgender people; but trans folk may want to avoid.
3274,20190073,"Narrative fiction can be a tunnel beneath borders that segregate us. Ebert's ""empathy machine"" metaphor is sexier than my analogy; but the idea is the same. This film is a soft; brief; genuine connection to a community that deserves compassion."
3275,20190073,It's a tender sojourn that; while a bit frayed in its narrative execution; atones with with a game spirit.
3276,20190073,It's one thing to decide to make a movie about the struggles of the transgender community and violent attacks on it. But it's far harder to turn that message into a film as natural and graceful as The Garden Left Behind.
3277,20190074,One of the greatest performances you'll see on the screen this year.
3278,20190074,Excellent performances and a sharp script by Roddy Doyle propel this harrowing drama about a working-class Irish mother of four struggling to find a safe home for her family following an eviction.
3279,20190074,It just goes to show that you don't always need life-or-death stakes to create nail-biting tension in a film.
3280,20190074,Rosie does not provide easy answers but finds hope in the family bonds that offer glimmers of light in our darkest moments.
3281,20190074,For anyone who has ever worked hard and worried about how to pay for tomorrow; Rosie hits a nerve.
3282,20190074,Sensitively directed by Paddy Breathnach and starring Sarah Greene this gut-wrenching; unsentimental study is powerful in its simplicity.
3283,20190074,Thanks to a sterling central turn from Greene (plus solid support from Moe Dunford as her hard-working hubby); the film pits the unfeeling state against the near-mythic resilience of the family unit.
3284,20190074,Doyle's screenplay is brutally specific about the overwhelming demands of child care under these circumstances; and Rosie's efforts to keep up appearances with relatives and school officials are heartbreaking.
3285,20190074,"Other films have bigger budgets and more glamorous stars; some even take home more awards. But few if any can quietly move you as much as ""Rosie."""
3286,20190074,A terrific movie and one of the best female performances of the year.
3287,20190074,This unspectacular film does a disciplined job of staying right on the edge.
3288,20190074,By employing techniques such as close-ups; extreme close-ups and hand-held long shots; Breathnach offers the viewer an unflinching look at Rosie's desperation; even as she's trying to keep up appearances.
3289,20190075,Matthias Schoenaerts is remarkable in soulful drama.
3290,20190075,Where we are left at the end feels like a culmination of a number of clunky beats that disrupt otherwise stellar work done both in-front of and behind the camera.
3291,20190075,French filmmaker Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre; who also co-wrote; impresses with a feature directorial debut that displays an understanding of film as both craft and poetry. She also displays a reverence and hope for flawed humanity...
3292,20190075,The Mustang; against all odds; moved me. It's not the most dense movie; nor is it the most interesting; but it's short; honest; and simple to the point of feeling pure.
3293,20190075,Superb acting and tight directing elevate this film about an inmate training a wild mustang.
3294,20190075,The film's ending is more bittersweet than feel-good. But Roland is left with a germ of hope that feels earned.
3295,20190075,"The Mustang could have held more surprises; but as a landscape study - ""Prison; with horses"" - it's ruggedly stunning."
3296,20190075,Manages to be inspirational without going Disney.
3297,20190075,While more modest in scale; this might be the most humane addition to the genre since The Shawshank Redemption.
3298,20190075,Animals have been coaxing the soft side out of tough guys since Clint Eastwood co-starred with an orangutan; yet there's still something poignant about this meathead engaging with a warmer world.
3299,20190075,Terse and elegiac at best; The Mustang is a dude Western from the Horse Whisperer school.
3300,20190075,[Their] connection is so wondrous and quietly powerful... This is lovely.
3301,20190076,"Billionaire from ""communist"" China buys former GM plant and pays workers less than what McDonald's pays. Evidence that capitalism victimizes workers across the planet; whatever the ideology."
3302,20190076,American Factory is a case study in cross-cultural miscommunication and national personality clash.
3303,20190076,Rarely does a sober; even-keeled reckoning come along to illuminate the human suffering of creative destruction while gently acknowledging that this is the way it has to be. Such a portrayal is American Factory; a heartbreaking Netflix documentary.
3304,20190076,Indeed; race relations seem to be a recurring theme; but one the filmmakers refuse to address head-on.
3305,20190076,The filmmaking does not advocate; it shows; never tells; and poses many more questions than it can answer. Some disturbing realities about the struggle for dignity in work emerge from what we witness.
3306,20190076,The unflinching examination is a bit of a mirror to the face and a gripping drama of where we are and may be heading.
3307,20190076,"Given the global context of the story; The title ""American Factory"" carries with it more than a hint of irony. But the documentary tells an increasingly American story."
3308,20190076,Sharply delineates the possibilities - and the limits - of a modern global economy.
3309,20190076,The movie is eye-opening - a windshield on the new world.
3310,20190076,Reichert and Bognar are clearly on the side of the workers; both American and Chinese; yet their film is no Michael Moore polemic. It's an old-school observational documentary in the very best sense of the term.
3311,20190076,American Factory sets out to chart what's supposed to be a test run for the future of the auto industry and an example of positive international relations. It ends up capturing a cross-cultural car wreck in slow motion.
3312,20190076,Could not have been more timely.
3313,20190077,Even if you don't like musicals but like documentaries; Fiddler has something to show you.
3314,20190077,It's a compelling tale; wonderfully told.
3315,20190077,I've adored Fiddler since childhood; so I watched this film with great pleasure. The only downside was that I wanted to hear the numbers all the way through. When it was over; I was ready for the show to start.
3316,20190077,[F]or every scholar who talks about the social implications of Fiddler and the resilience that birthed it; there's one that spells out baseline interpretations of the text.
3317,20190077,"Most of all; Lewkowicz shows how even though ""Fiddler"" - both the original musical and the 1971 Norman Jewison-directed movie - is primarily a Jewish story; it still manages to speak to audiences across both generations and national boundaries."
3318,20190077,"Director Max Lewkowicz assembled an extraordinary collection of talking heads to discuss their lives with ""Fiddler""."
3319,20190077,There's considerable pleasure to be had here; particularly in the interweaving of several decades' performance clips in various staging styles and languages.
3320,20190077,It made me totally want to go see [Fiddler on the Roof] again... A really enlightening documentary.
3321,20190077,What makes it brilliant is that it demonstrates how universal this distinctly Jewish musical has become; how it has been embraced by many cultures and how it is still influential today.
3322,20190077,"A Miracle of Miracles examines both the development of the much loved ""dark musical"" and its enduring popularity for audiences all around the world."
3323,20190077,The clip of the Temptations singing a cover of If I Were a Rich Man is worth the price of admission alone.
3324,20190077,While never preachy; the director Max Lewkowicz nonetheless makes the case that Fiddler remains a vital and urgent piece of art about refugees; intolerance and the perennial clash of modernity with; yep; sing it with me; tradition!
3325,20190078,Indeed; Working Woman is a timely film that echoes the chaotic contemporary times in which the perverse nature of the corruptible work-related politics/subculture has gone immorally awry.
3326,20190078,An excellent no-nonsense drama.
3327,20190078,Everything is achieved with limited resources; exploring the vitality of empty spaces where there are no answers; and turning silence into the best ally for any reflection. [Full Review in Spanish]
3328,20190078,Working Woman has a high level of suspense. [Full review in Spanish]
3329,20190078,The film focuses on its protagonist's solitary battle and exposes with subtlety and rawness. [Full Review in Spanish]
3330,20190078,Better known as a documentarian; veteran Israeli director Michael Aviad brings an unblinking eye to this harrowing and thought-provoking tale of sexual harassment.
3331,20190078,"""Working Woman"" may sound familiar; but be prepared: It cuts closer to the bone than you will be ready for."
3332,20190078,An understated polemic that becomes an affecting drama.
3333,20190078,This is one of the few films about sexual harassment in the workplace that has the feel of authenticity. With quiet; incremental force; it brings home the helplessness and terrors of being trapped.
3334,20190078,"""Working Woman"" sends an audience out steaming that justice in such cases often remains undone."
3335,20190078,Although commendably relatable; the story line at times feels too familiar; save for later scenes in which Orna makes some choices that lead to a (mostly) satisfying ending.
3336,20190078,This is a supremely clever movie; rooted in strong emotion that's rigorously controlled. It's a work of passion; told with utmost restraint. That makes it even more effective.
3337,20190079,It's a good documentary on a great subject; it leaves us with a deeper appreciation of the creativity and painstaking discipline of these artists; and their contribution to our favorite movies.
3338,20190079,...a little bit of everything: history; aesthetic exploration; technological geek out.
3339,20190079,One of the year's best.
3340,20190079,This documentary offers a rich; comprehensive treatment of sound in movies that gives the viewer some appreciation of the effort it takes to make a movie with a good sound design.
3341,20190079,Succeeds as an accessible and entertaining ode to the innovators; the craftsmen; and the technology that continues to give the cinema experience new life.
3342,20190079,It's a lot to cover in 90 minutes; and given the breadth of the subject it's something only a Mark Cousin-esque full-length TV series could give real justice to.
3343,20190079,A practically perfect primer for anyone interested in the history and craft of filmmaking; answering most of the pertinent; baseline questions while leaving plenty of room for supplemental research.
3344,20190079,"""Making Waves"" is about the evolution of film technology; yet the key to its appeal is that it revels in the holistic; aesthetic side of technology: not just buttons and dials and gizmos; but technology as an expression of something human."
3345,20190079,If it feels like a feelgood in-house promotional video for Hollywood technicians ... well; they've got an awful lot to feel good about.
3346,20190079,"Just see this film. And then wonder if ""see"" is any longer an adequate verb for the act of experiencing great cinema."
3347,20190079,The blend of historical overview; film clips; tech info; and inside business on offer is pretty irresistible.
3348,20190079,You wouldn't seize on film sound as the sexiest of subjects; yet Midge Costin's documentary is a doozy; as inspiring as it is informative.
3349,20190080,The Cave is an emergency call that shows; with respect; the suffering of civilians. [Full review in spanish]
3350,20190080,Isolated from their families; they sometimes break down and director Feras Fayyad (Last Men In Aleppo; 2017) knows just how to linger on those moments.
3351,20190080,A triumph of both artistry and humanity; this powerful and topical documentary finds a harrowing new angle to the ongoing Syrian unrest.
3352,20190080,Such is the intensity of The Cave that the dramatic music of Matthew Herbert feels unnecessary. [Full review in Spanish]
3353,20190080,...raw and painful to watch; contain scenes of arresting intimacy...
3354,20190080,The Cave' is not a documentary that is going to make history; but it is a crude portrait of a true story that deserved further dissemination. [Full Review in Spanish]
3355,20190080,It's no surprise the film won the People's Choice Documentary Award at this year's Toronto International Film Festival.
3356,20190080,A profile in courage under fire; The Cave sometimes relieves its enervating tension with occasional MASH-like interludes of levity: a surprise birthday party; some bickering over rice recipes; thoughtful drags on cigarettes.
3357,20190080,A blistering documentary about death defiance in a war zone.
3358,20190080,Manipulations in post-production slightly undermine material that is already dramatic enough.
3359,20190080,Like Ballour; it has a purpose: to focus the world's attention on the suffering of Syrian people.
3360,20190080,It's still profoundly effective film-making; but feels less true.
3361,20190081,Greenfield is careful to balance the vast shoe collections and showers of banknotes with victim testimony about the notorious period of martial law Imelda's husband imposed on enemies of the state.
3362,20190081,The Kingmaker is less a historical biography than a timely cautionary tale.
3363,20190081,What's interesting about the film is that at the center is this ludicrous; ridiculous figure. As the doc scratches away at this; you see grotesque horror; and I thought that was a very astute way of approaching this.
3364,20190081,Even with repeated beats; The Kingmaker still begs to be watched. What it lacks in focus it makes up in personality.
3365,20190081,It's almost as if [Lauren Greenfield has] been working up to this; it's a perfectly logical move for her after her last two films.
3366,20190081,A well-researched cautionary tale of what can befall a nation that allows a familial pack of jackals to loot the resources of a struggling; impoverished country.
3367,20190081,For all that Marcos has to be one of the most purely objectionable figures in public life anywhere in the world; she is not a fool and occasionally reveals shrewd insights about herself.
3368,20190081,While the film starts in wry fly-on-the-wall mode; it morphs into something weightier and surreally unsettling - Louis Theroux to Luis Buñuel in 60 minutes flat.
3369,20190081,It's dark material; expertly handled.
3370,20190081,From her very first simper; I was hooked. Some see Imelda as one of the world's greatest villains. After this tour of her closet; that shoe fits.
3371,20190081,The Kingmaker is a thoroughly entertaining primer on the past; present; and perhaps future of Filipino politics
3372,20190081,It's grimly compelling viewing as Marcos gives filmmaker Lauren Greenfield intimate access to her opulent life and oblivious narcissism.
3373,20190082,One leaves Love; Antosha with both a profound sense of loss and boundless admiration for a young man determined to cram as much life as possible into however many years he was granted.
3374,20190082,Love; Antosha does a lot with very little time; which is nothing if not fitting.
3375,20190082,Anton Yelchin was a talented actor who never had a real breakthrough role. He was always on the cusp of breaking through but fate robbed him of that chance. This film portrays all that but never quite draws the audience into the story.
3376,20190082,This is the kind of remembrance most actors could only dream of. It's also tremendous fun to watch.
3377,20190082,Love; Antosha can't be anything but a love-fest; don't think it isn't earned. [Rather than] lament about what will now never be; enjoy it as a reason to appreciate what was.
3378,20190082,A deeply moving portrait of the extraordinary life and death of Russian-American film actor Anton Yelchin (1989-2016).
3379,20190082,Price has given us Yelchin's most complete performance: himself. It is a cinematic gift to contemporary film fans everywhere.
3380,20190082,The title is how the immigrant's child closed his frequent and heartfelt letters to his fiercely devoted mother Irina; and the film plays a bit like her loving reply: a tribute to the son whose grave she still visits daily.
3381,20190082,It's very powerful and also very sad.
3382,20190082,"Mostly; the Antosha of ""Love; Antosha"" seems like a good kid: someone whose life -- and tragic death -- should inspire us to spend our brief time here as wisely and as well as he did."
3383,20190082,It serves as both a celebration of Yelchin's life and a tribute to his parents; particularly his mother. That infuses the film with a warmth and compassion that keeps it from feeling like a funeral-service memorial.
3384,20190082,Though clearly an adoring tribute; Love; Antosha allows its subject a sort of complicated humanity that expands our understanding of him.
3385,20190083,In French with English subtitles; it's an inventive; non-linear; urban fairy tale about destiny and resilience.
3386,20190083,The animation here is not; in and of itself; extraordinary. The story; however; is as unusual as it sounds and just as riotously inventive.
3387,20190083,A mature piece of animation that resonates in unusual ways.
3388,20190083,A rarity. [Full review in Spanish]
3389,20190083,It is a different kind of tale about young love. Intimately told and drawn; it is well worth the 81 minute time investment.
3390,20190083,A clever premise overcomes occasionally cheap-looking animation.
3391,20190083,"As inventive a piece of animation as you're likely to see; the extraordinary ""I Lost My Body"" is about a hand with a mind of its own; and if that sounds a little crazy; this dark; strange and altogether wonderful feature will make you believe."
3392,20190083,Anyone who's willing to meet this movie on its own terms and roll with the dream logic it requires will be rewarded with a resonantly cathartic saga.
3393,20190083,Hands down; this is the best animation of 2019.
3394,20190083,It's a strange; sad yarn; full of yearning.
3395,20190083,Until I watched I Lost My Body; I never thought I'd sit with bated breath; rooting for a severed hand o defy the laws of physics and hurl itself up a ladder rung by rung.
3396,20190083,A gloriously hand-animated existential fable that manages to be both genuinely sweet and thoroughly twisted.
3397,20190084,It is a creative and aesthetic masterpiece.
3398,20190084,"Not much more to say; ""Shadow"" is one of the greatest wuxia films of all time; an audiovisual poem and overall; a true masterpiece."
3399,20190084,There's a certain traditional type of ink finger-painting in China that director Zhang Yimou's new movie evokes to seductive perfection.
3400,20190084,f you like sword fights you should like this wuxia film despite its confusing palace intrigues.
3401,20190084,It has the goods; both as spectacle and as an enjoyable dense political thriller.
3402,20190084,This heightened atmosphere sets the perfect tone for the story; which is rife with scheming; torqued emotion; and of course; incredible fight scenes.
3403,20190084,A rapturously beautiful work...combining the exquisite details of Chinese ink-brush painting with the melodramatic extravagance and suspension of disbelief of opera.
3404,20190084,"""Shadow"" is absurdly entertaining once you get past that first introductory hurdle. But the rest of the film is well worth the wait."
3405,20190084,Shadow isn't quite as perfect as one might wish.
3406,20190084,"It's always good to see this side of Zhang's work. ""Shadow"" will not soon be forgotten."
3407,20190084,If The Great Wall felt like Yimou was turning his greatest hits into something dispassionately bland; then Shadow takes the familiar and makes it feel startlingly new.
3408,20190084,You've gotta see it to believe it.
3409,20190085,If the subject all sounds like doom and gloom; Ray & Liz offsets its depressing subject matter through empathy and humour.
3410,20190085,Curiously; in the hard domestic portrait that the director traces there is not a moment of rancor or bitterness. [Full Review in Spanish]
3411,20190085,Despite failure to provide context of family dysfunction within the rust-belt of Black Country in Northern England; it is still a keenly-observed portrait of the director's own family.
3412,20190085,The film clearly demonstrates why Billingham's childhood has informed so much of his artistic career; but it proves a little harder to find a way to empathise with it.
3413,20190085,In 108 spare; harrowing minutes; we see the walls closing in on a family that's given up; never equipped to deal with the despair of Margaret Thatcher's Britain.
3414,20190085,Whilst it doesn't follow a concrete narrative; Ray & Liz  is a moving portrayal of a family trying to stay above the poverty line.
3415,20190085,[A] film in which the memories you can't shake and the memories you won't let go become indistinguishable from the ones you never had.
3416,20190085,With its very tamped-down emotion; Bellingham's decision not to attempt insight or empathy is the most telling display of the consequences of his story.
3417,20190085,"Performed with absolute commitment by its cast (Justin Salinger and Ella Smith play the younger versions of the title characters); ""Ray & Liz"" is a quietly harrowing movie."
3418,20190085,"We often say art ""cuts close to the bone;"" but in its depiction of clinking liquor bottles and drawers of unopened rent notices soaked in dog urine; Ray & Liz slices clean through that bone."
3419,20190085,Billingham's famous photos are tough-minded and emotionally painful; silent by virtue of their medium. And his live-action version offers a similar experience.
3420,20190085,"What distinguishes ""Ray & Liz"" is its ability to find strange tonal nuances within that terrible sadness; bleak as it is; it's remarkably devoid of bitterness or rancor; and even its most despairing passages are flecked with humor and hope."
3421,20190086,...a beautifully realised film that engages with the true potentials of contemporary cinema.
3422,20190086,It's not the funniest comedy nor the scariest horror film; but is absolutely the most committed haunted-dress movie of the year. It's Peter Strickland; it's full of artistic integrity; and it's fabulous.
3423,20190086,A cautionary tale for any woman who has ever fallen for a new outfit.
3424,20190086,Strickland's cinema is just not for me. I find no connection between his wonderful style and stories. But I know there's something there I will discover soon. [Full review in Spanish].
3425,20190086,What happens... reveals to us the most playful and complex-free face of a constantly evolving filmmaker. [Full review in Spanish]
3426,20190086,It's as though the last 50 years never happened and Rome's Cinecittà Studios are still turning out the films that defied and then defined the psychological horror genre.
3427,20190086,A little too arch and over-concocted for its own good...
3428,20190086,Strickland and his cast play it (sort of) straight; aiming for the difficult target of horror-comedy. Comedy wins; but not without some truly gruesome set pieces that take a shrieking delight in the dress wreaking bloody havoc.
3429,20190086,Few people could get away with making haunted couture seem chilling without being kitsch; or turn ridiculously verbose retail-speak into something both sidesplitting and unnerving.
3430,20190086,"""In Fabric"" is bespoke horror for a discerning and self-selecting clientele."
3431,20190086,This is not the film to see if you're after a sleazy good time. It's more like a game of hunt the symbol; with possible interpretations scattered so thickly it is hard to pick just one.
3432,20190086,I was mesmerized.
3433,20190087,The film's exhaustive investigation into her life and legacy uncovers plenty of maddening instances of sexism... but it also highlights the concerted efforts of archivists and historians to start setting the record straight.
3434,20190087,By the end of this two-hour impeccably researched and well-curated production; you will not only learn of Guy-Blache's well-rounded oeuvre that tackles a varied array of genres... But your very notion of what silent films are like might be elevated.
3435,20190087,Green succeeded in creating a beautiful; neat tapestry; weaving together the loose threads left behind by Guy-Blaché; helping to reinstate her in the history of cinema.
3436,20190087,Newly-discovered footage of Guy-Blaché films and the subject herself; including rare audio recordings and a restored video interview enrich her portrait...
3437,20190087,We can see comedy; social drama; even a few westerns in there...her name should never; ever be forgotten again.
3438,20190087,This frustrating and exhilarating documentary is mandatory viewing for any cinephile.
3439,20190087,It definitely piques your interest about her work.
3440,20190087,The ingrained sexism it highlights could form the basis of several sequels.
3441,20190087,[A] hectic; garrulous; fascinating documentary...
3442,20190087,A playful but ardent documentary tribute to Guy Blaché; a film-maker fully deserving the overworked title of pioneer.
3443,20190087,Cineastes; film nerds and feminists alike will be gripped by this documentary portrait of Alice Guy-Blaché. Who? That's the point.
3444,20190087,It's the awkward editing; superfluous celebrity interviews; and an emphasis on the search for inconsequential facts that obscure what should be its focus - Guy-Blaché's formidable talent.
3445,20190088,The script is fantastic... It plays almost like an Ocean's 11 movie.
3446,20190088,A thoughtful; cerebral entry in this black renaissance period.
3447,20190088,In typical Soderbergh fashion; High Flying Bird is a film about basketball featuring no games of basketball; and a thriller that derives its suspense from the fast-paced; rhythmic dialogue of Tarrel Alvin McCraney.
3448,20190088,High Flying Bird is [Soderbergh's] anarchist's cookbook for besting capitalist systems and getting narratives out into the light that they would keep in darkness.
3449,20190088,This is a film rich with ideas and discussion points; including black entrepreneurship; and the tangled racial history of a country intertwined with a sport that is supposed to offer people of colour a sense of 'freedom'.
3450,20190088,This intriguing; if erratic drama is sure to be prominent on the feeds of... who love their sports.
3451,20190088,I think the paring of [Steven Soderbergh] and Tarell Alvin McCraney is inspired. It's such a beautiful; sharp; layered script.
3452,20190088,The director and cinematographer is Steven Soderbergh; who has recently returned after a blessedly brief 2012 retirement with manic energy. High Flying Bird continues his stream of crafting the tightest; snappiest pieces of movie work in recent memory.
3453,20190088,A Promethean sports drama that hums with the verve and purpose of Soderbergh's very best work.
3454,20190088,High Flying Bird could be called an anti-Sports Movie: its goal is not to uplift; but rather to provoke; mobilize and envision a future in which the players themselves own the league.
3455,20190088,Directed; shot; and edited by Steven Soderbergh; this cerebral Netflix original is an even more incisive drama about the business of sports than Moneyball.
3456,20190088,Soderbergh's liveliest; most big-thinking work since Magic Mike; this is a quick; zingy; all-business sports drama that plays like Jerry Maguire with twin degrees in economics and sociology.
3457,20190089,The magic of this mostly fictional film from Netflix is that it imagines an example of authentic listening and dialogue.
3458,20190089,At its heart; The Two Popes is really about two old chaps; who just happen to be a Pope and a Pope-in-waiting; finding something liberating in an unexpected friendship. And what a blessing that story is. Don't miss it.
3459,20190089,The script by Anthony McCarten is crisp and often amusing; director Fernando Meirelles does a fine job of basically taking what could have been a two-character; one-set stage play and opening it up with gorgeous sets.
3460,20190089,It gives Catholics and non-Catholics alike some of the feelings that faith should provide.
3461,20190089,It works as an intriguing drama; and one that reflects the clash of ideologies that exists within the Church even today. [Full review in Spanish]
3462,20190089,A lapsed Catholic's lament on the state of the Church as symbolised by its leaders old and new.
3463,20190089,...we lose just a little too much momentum.
3464,20190089,The actors are such pros that the woodenness of the dialogue and implausibility of the set-up that McCarten has saddled them with almost don't matter. Almost.
3465,20190089,"""The Two Popes"" tells the story of one of the most consequential moments in the history of the Catholic Church with subtlety and grace; including two of the finest performances of the year."
3466,20190089,What emerges is a discussion of beliefs and responsibilities; yes; but mostly the story of two men at personal and ideological crossroads that happened to intersect on a world stage.
3467,20190089,The screenplay by McCarten effectively balances moments of levity and weight...
3468,20190089,It is really beautifully acted; and a lot of times it does feel like a play on film in all the best ways.
3469,20190090,Bad Education foreshadows the traditional 'true-crime' genre and becomes a truly exhilarating drama sprinkled with moments of pure black comedic grace
3470,20190090,Bad Education is in the same spirit as films like Spotlight or last year's Bombshell; but deals with a case of much smaller scale. Still; it balances well between black comedy and suspense within the same space.
3471,20190090,A biting drama about how just a little bit of power can do a whole lot of wrong.
3472,20190090,Finley's sharp; nicely nuanced treatment proves that dramatizing bad behavior in school administrative offices can make for a good movie; especially when bolstered by performances from the likes of Jackman and Janney.
3473,20190090,Excellent performances make tepid subject exciting.
3474,20190090,Whatever you do; don't look up details of this fascinating affair before you see the movie; as it is highly capable of getting you truly sucked in as a whodunnit.
3475,20190090,Director Cory Finley finds the dark humor within this scandal; which he depicts with wit; style; and a terrific cast.
3476,20190090,With Hugh Jackman and Allison Janney as a can't-miss combination; Bad Education joins a juicy true story somewhere in the middle; drags before getting into the meat of it; and then rallies solidly in the second half.
3477,20190090,[A] bright; sharp-edged satire with the gift of two great comedic actors: Hugh Jackman and Allison Janney.
3478,20190090,"It's Tassone's perspective that Finley largely keeps to; which - if you don't know the true story - lets ""Bad Education"" unspool if not surprisingly at least captivatingly."
3479,20190090,"Jackman captures that dichotomy perfectly; and makes ""Bad Education"" an offbeat treat."
3480,20190090,Jackman does a magnificent job of portraying a man who has been lying so long on so many fronts; even he isn't sure of the truth any longer.
3481,20190091,[Monos] is; by all means; a dark; intense and unforgiving coming of age film that might just be one of the most daring films of 2019.
3482,20190091,There are allusions to William Golding's Lord of the Flies; but that fine novel; and Peter Brook's 1962 screen adaptation; though also elliptical; provided far more satisfying drama than Landes somewhat frustrating epic...
3483,20190091,Essential viewing for anyone seeking an intense survival experience told with expert framing.
3484,20190091,Despite all the references; it's bracingly original. That duality is also present as a travelogue: here are some of the most beautiful locations in the world; exquisitely shot; along with reason to never visit them.
3485,20190091,[...] a stunning looking film; but the musical approach [from Mica Levi] is what really makes it stick in your head...
3486,20190091,A brutal; engrossing; superbly well-shot; well-scored and better-than-average thriller of child-soldiers at war.
3487,20190091,An experience at once jagged and lyrical; brutal and beautiful; angry and abstract; scattered and wholly singular.
3488,20190091,[A] gorgeously shot; haunting look at human nature at its fraying edges.
3489,20190091,Muscular filmmaking. Physically shaken; in a good way.
3490,20190091,Monos; in its surreal power and persuasiveness; deserves to be called a sci-fi epic of the here and the now.
3491,20190091,Monos is gorgeous; but it is also lucid as hell. And it all happens at lightning speed.
3492,20190091,The performances from the young cast are vivid and utterly credible; yet the conspicuously metaphorical nature of the context eventually becomes wearisome.
3493,20190092,It's all good; gory fun; the three leads bouncing off each another like energetic; morally bankrupt pinballs sent careening across a playfield.
3494,20190092,Harpoon focuses on human horror and how we unravel when the bonds we make with people we see as close fall apart.
3495,20190092,This is a cruel story of people of adrift at sea with no moral compass and I loved it.
3496,20190092,It may not be the most original single location thriller you'll ever see but it is certainly one of the most tense and engaging.
3497,20190092,At its core; Harpoon isn't aiming for deep statements about the human condition; opting instead to spin a fun; bloody yarn.
3498,20190092,The writing and directing set that up and make the most out of it; creating a great film with some truly uncomfortable moment; making Harpoon a must-see film for horror fans and those who like twisted films with dark humor and some nicely sinister twists.
3499,20190092,Some of the stylistic fillips feel excessive; and at the end of the day; this is just a tawdry; gory B-picture; with little to say about human behavior. But it's often funny and generally suspenseful - a fine afternoon on the water; all things considered.
3500,20190092,A nasty look at pride; betrayal and misnamed nautical gear on the open sea.
3501,20190092,The energetic mix of mayhem and snark will appeal to those who like their comedy horrific and their horror comedic.
3502,20190092,I was impressed by [director] Rob Grant's ability to accomplish a lot with a little and in a very confined space.
3503,20190092,Grant adds lots of fisticuffs and gore to the proceedings; but it's Gelman's voice that answer's the narrative's numerous SOS calls.
3504,20190092,"""Harpoon"" offers stylish compositions; amusing running gags and sharp; snappy dialogue. It's a sparse; nasty little thriller."
3505,20190093,The incredible graphics remain pretty incredible and while it won't feel quite as fresh; it will still relentlessly tickle the funny bone.
3506,20190093,It feels much more like a big toy commercial. One big problem I had was that it seemed predicated on very outdated gender stereotypes.
3507,20190093,The obvious parallels you might make won't overshadow what the barrage of glitter; color; and catchy tunes will do to make you smile; forget the mess the world is in; and enjoy your popcorn. The real world can wait.
3508,20190093,With such an acclaimed animation film as its predecessor; The Lego Movie 2 aims to up the stakes in terms of imagination and entertainment. Thankfully; it delivers in buckets.
3509,20190093,"It's not as ""awesome"" as the first one; but it's still creative and very funny."
3510,20190093,All in all; The LEGO Movie 2 feels like more movie than the first one; which somehow winds up making it feel like less.
3511,20190093,Exhausted; and exhausting.
3512,20190093,Suffice to say that it's a hell of a ride; with poignant things to say about the earnestness of adolescence and the frustrations of sibling conflict.
3513,20190093,"Viewers reared on ""The Lego Movie"" will find plenty to nourish them anew."
3514,20190093,By this point... I think I've had enough of The Lego Movies. These things can only go so far and I think they may have exceeded their natural life span.
3515,20190093,A semi-brilliant family movie; guaranteed to leave both kids and adults buzzing.
3516,20190093,If you're willing to let the quantum mechanics slide; you'll have a pretty awesome time.
3517,20190094,This is a really chilling psychological thriller that illuminates racism in American in a different way than more common approaches. It asks; 'What is the cost of submerging one's identity; history and race in order to conform to white standards?'
3518,20190094,It's a film that wants you to remain as unsure of yourself as you are of the people it introduces - all the while insisting you fill in the gaps and provide the answers.
3519,20190094,Very impressed by this. Surprised by this film; with all its twists and turns...it wasn't as complex; but it was definitely terrifying...
3520,20190094,The sky's the limit for [Kelvin Harrison Jr.]...
3521,20190094,Writer/director Julius Onah (The Girl is in Trouble) has a lot to say; but; with this powerhouse cast; he saves some of his best moments for the quiet spaces; between the words. Very recommended.
3522,20190094,Luce is one of the biggest surprises of 2019. It's a socio-psychological thriller that intensifies like a ticking bomb.
3523,20190094,This earnest race drama occasionally flirts with turning into a sociopath thriller. You'll kind of wish it did.
3524,20190094,A convincing and confidant example of sustained menace.
3525,20190094,Luce feels theatrical in the wrong way: muddled and contrived.
3526,20190094,Staginess stalks the enterprise throughout; a prowling figure in an opera cape; and ends by strangling everyone with the cords of loquacity; moralism and story contrivance.
3527,20190094,It's Spencer's performance that ends up packing most of the film's heat. Where the other characterisations dither or flip-flop; hers deepens; intensified and shaken by the war of ideas.
3528,20190094,Adapted by Onah and JC Lee from Lee's play of the same name; it's chilling and provocative; sharply written and sensationally acted by a cast of big-hitters and unknowns.
3529,20190095,When Belkin continues on the straight-and-narrow; he creates a stolid stream of consciousness. When he gets sidetracked; the movie begins to feel like a rough edit.
3530,20190095,At its most successful; the film draws a line from his childhood insecurities; to the bouts of crippling depression Wallace experienced at the height of his success.
3531,20190095,While the film fails to address its subject's reporting on LGBTQ issues; the piece does cover a huge swath of the life and work of a man who lived to be 93; and didn't retire until age 88.
3532,20190095,Avi Belkin's Mike Wallace Is Here harvests a vast archive of interviews and b-roll footage to create a fascinating profile of a combative; conflicted figure; who nevertheless substantially changed the face of how news was reported.
3533,20190095,A little more air might have been welcome; but this remains a hugely entertaining film for anyone interested in the American way of communicating.
3534,20190095,It's pure cinema: dramatic; ambiguous; devastating - and one more reason this particular film doesn't need to reference a fictionalised version of its own star's role in history.
3535,20190095,This is a time capsule - an expertly crafted time capsule - of an astonishing career.
3536,20190095,The film deftly weaves news and interview clips from Wallace's half-century on TV with the times he himself answered questions as tough as those he asked; fleshing out one of the country's last formidable journalists.
3537,20190095,Belkin floats the notion that Wallace's sharp-tongued style paved the way for the lying loudmouths who now populate our fractured media landscape; but it feels like a half-hearted bid for contemporary relevance. At least his prickishness had purpose.
3538,20190095,A solid piece of cultural investigation built around a man who helped write history while it happened.
3539,20190095,Terrific and informative.
3540,20190095,This film does not offer any actual conclusions; but it is an atmospheric immersion in the old; smoky and very male world of American TV journalism.
3541,20190096,Beautiful; mysterious; lyrical and somehow relaxing in spite of its sadness and persistent instances of violence; there's a hallucinatory aura that surrounds Hu's film; thanks primarily to the lyricism of his camera.
3542,20190096,Hu takes time to let the camera linger on his characters' faces; capturing their troubled psyche... Often; their reticence conveys depths that words deem unnecessary.
3543,20190096,In looking at life in northern China; Bo presents a society that has lost its way; downtrodden; selfish and living in isolation in an industrial landscape devoid of natural beauty...yet for all the film's depressing story lines; Bo achieves hope...
3544,20190096,Despite its melancholia and tonal rigor; An Elephant Sitting Still exudes so much elegance; frame precision and ingenuity. Hu Bo's first and last feature is destined to have a place in cinema.
3545,20190096,It's as if the film was conjured from thin air; gorgeous; elemental; and tortured; Hu's consciousness made manifest and brought into being by sheer force of will.
3546,20190096,"If you do not; at least once across the running time; think to yourself; ""why is it so LONG?""; the film is not doing its job properly."
3547,20190096,An act of solemn; disciplined and passionate protest.
3548,20190096,While circumstances are claustrophobic and stifling; Bo's movie seems to balance that with strange and surreal impulses of the heart.
3549,20190096,This is not the feel-good film of the year. And yet; the story builds towards a climactic trip to see the mythical elephant in Manzhouli; and old Wang Jin is eager to go along for the ride.
3550,20190096,[Hu] has given us a triumph of bold sociopolitical critique and intimate human portraiture; and a reminder that you rarely encounter the one without the other.
3551,20190096,I wanted to connect with it; but I am the monster who could not get into the four-hour tragic movie.
3552,20190096,The most audacious debut feature from mainland China since Wang Bing's nine-hour documentary West of the Tracks (2002).
3553,20190097,Playful; funny and relevant to the world we live in today; Jojo Rabbit condemns violence with a gaze that dances with adolescent imagination taking hold over itself.
3554,20190097,A silly movie about hate; rather than be a film that proves how silly hate can be.
3555,20190097,JoJo Rabbit doesn't work as a satire because no matter how much time has passed; the tragedy continues to overwhelm the ridiculous.
3556,20190097,Wes Anderson is a good reference point; Waititi's film is saturated in a similar aesthetic and tone.
3557,20190097,Jojo Rabbit feels genuinely spontaneous from moment to moment even as Watiti's clear focus on motif and foreshadowing reveals a film that reflexes and reflects upon itself.
3558,20190097,One of director Waititi's real achievements is balancing his orchestration of this fantastical fable with the need to make periodic guest appearances as Adolph.
3559,20190097,A staggeringly ill-conceived satire that completely fails to explore its own premise.
3560,20190097,A pointless Hitler-spoofy YA adventure with a 12A certificate; obtusely accentuating little-kid cuteness and optimism amid the quaintly imagined non-horror.
3561,20190097,Jojo Rabbit is bold in its inversion of expectations and its reimagining of a familiar subject. There's nothing trivial about it.
3562,20190097,Jojo Rabbit is many things; well-intentioned among them. Brilliant it is not.
3563,20190097,The tonal shifts in Jojo Rabbit don't work because they're not seriously intended; the intention here being instead to remain consistently cute.
3564,20190097,Taika Waititi's film is tender; daring; and sharp -- precisely pitched so that it keeps its path steady and its ambitions in check.
3565,20190098,In its best moments; this is a powerfully moving; sympathetic portrait of a young artist who is deeply confused about herself and life.
3566,20190098,It's a layered; rooted; and just-left-of-symmetrical picture that allows viewers to fill in as much or as little of everyone's history as they'd like.
3567,20190098,The Souvenir certainly breaks new ground; illustrating just how much you can show without showing. 'Telling' you about it can't quite do it justice.
3568,20190098,As this is Honor's first acting role; her constant vulnerability throughout is painfully real.
3569,20190098,While the final act is perhaps a touch too long; this is a quietly intense character study immersing us into a young woman's first love that will eventually shape all others that follow.
3570,20190098,A beautifully made film; but one so impossibly dripping with privilege it starts to become distracting. [However;] the film acknowledges this and doesn't really do anything with it
3571,20190098,Tender and charming; but the bitter sting elevates it to greatness.
3572,20190098,The sense of real life rerun is vivid. Hogg keeps you in the palm of her hand as few film-makers could.
3573,20190098,As rousing and exhilarating as anything you'll see in a Hollywood blockbuster or high-level horror.
3574,20190098,The absolute specificity of this story makes it universal too. It's the best British film for a long time.
3575,20190098,Hogg's lighter touch discourages easy judgment. Despite this she has a knack for the kind of vignette that speaks volumes about a relationship.
3576,20190098,[Joanna Hogg] makes brilliant use of shallow focus to keep you keyed in to specific details.
3577,20190099,Film fans have waited eight years for Joe Cornish to make his follow-up to Attack the Block; but The Kid Who Would Be King is unfortunately a tad underwhelming.
3578,20190099,[Joe] Cornish's attempt at merging a classic legend with our modern day issues is successful.
3579,20190099,A perfectly pleasant; if a touch innocuous; rejigging of the Arthurian legend for a modern audience.
3580,20190099,Did the world really need another blowhard Arthur and a Round Table of gritty; humorless fanatics? The Kid Who Would Be King's good-natured positivity seems much more appropriate to the moment.
3581,20190099,Joe Cornish's timely retelling of Arthurian legend is an adventure for the whole family.
3582,20190099,Grab the kids and go see it. Go laugh; maybe get a bit weepy and get fully engaged in a cracking story. Are you not entertained?
3583,20190099,Cornish is a witty and inventive director but the basic conceit here never really works.
3584,20190099,This movie is sentimental in all the right places; and impossible to dislike.
3585,20190099,A crowning achievement.
3586,20190099,If you factor in the movie's faith in the kindness of children and its eventual optimism about the future; it becomes; in essence; a healing myth for the ills of contemporary Britain. With or without a deal.
3587,20190099,It's got a great kid-energy to it; but also [has] real adventures; real danger; and real stakes.
3588,20190099,The movie has the freshness; innocence; and energy of youngsters on the threshold of adulthood; embarked on a grand heroic adventure.
3589,20190100,Learning a little of her life is a fine way to spend 100 minutes of your own.
3590,20190100,It is a life worth recording and discovering; and the perfect subject for a documentary.
3591,20190100,Will answer most of your questions about former Karola Ruth Siegel...through a spirited tour of much of what she has experienced and done during her long and remarkable life.
3592,20190100,Dr. Ruth's life story is remarkable and worthy of Oscar-bait dramatization. Until then; the worthy gift that Ask Dr. Ruth is will do.
3593,20190100,The movie connects Westheimer's biography both to her philosophy toward sex and how she cultivated her famous persona.
3594,20190100,As a film; Ask Dr. Ruth is a delight.
3595,20190100,A long-overdue bio-doc that; in its spirited way; is as affirming as last year's paean to another important octogenarian Ruth; RBG.
3596,20190100,Ask Dr. Ruth has some surprises for all but the most devoted of Westheimer's followers.
3597,20190100,The film does a great job of contextualizing the phenom of Dr. Ruth.
3598,20190100,Director Ryan White's documentary depicts Dr. Ruth as lovable every-granny - if your grandmother was a celebrity sex therapist not shy around STIs; vibrators and porn.
3599,20190100,Whether it's Ruth reflecting on the details of her three marriages with her characteristic frankness or her family unpacking her political stances; it offers up insight into a woman who helped so many others truly know themselves.
3600,20190100,She is good at deflecting those who want to pry and that's a problem for the film. If we're going to go 100 minutes with this remarkable old lady; a little depth is pretty much required.
3601,20200001,Director Celine Sciamma has made something far more than a period costume flick. She's made a romance portraying explosive longing through steady glances and brief caresses.
3602,20200001,Beautiful French drama about female lovers has nudity.
3603,20200001,Sciamma's work joins a select group of texts that brilliantly thematise the power of the image - either through painting; drawing or photography.
3604,20200001,a beautifully mounted drama about forbidden love that has every reason to be an intense emotional experience; but somehow never quite shakes free from its carefully designed and modulated aesthetic
3605,20200001,...an exquisite love story.
3606,20200001,"From the soulful gazes of her film's two protagonists; to the repeated references to women bemoaning the powerlessness of their positions; Sciamma's ""Portrait of a Lady on Fire"" is a testament to the depths of feminine desire."
3607,20200001,Sciamma conjures the past with such clarity you clean forget the modern world and the crew crouched in fleeces and headphones just out of shot. Such; done right; is the magic of cinema.
3608,20200001,It's an all-in effort; and Sciamma has created something of a masterwork. It's a deeply layered story - a brush-up on the story of Orpheus and Eurydice wouldn't hurt - with themes that transcend era and setting. This girl is on fire.
3609,20200001,This is a film about looking; female looking specifically.
3610,20200001,It could have been claustrophobic but the central story is so passionately involving you don't want to look elsewhere at all.
3611,20200001,It's a slow burn; sure; but the embers are remarkable.
3612,20200001,Even without showing men onscreen; Sciamma depicts the myriad ways in which the patriarchy constricts the lives of her female protagonists.
3613,20200002,1917 is one of the best war films I have ever seen. Epic from beginning to end; it truly captures the horrors of trench warfare.
3614,20200002,"One word: immersive. That's pretty much sums up Sam Mendes' highly-ambitious World War I epic; ""1917""."
3615,20200002,A tribute to; and reminder of; those brave men; young and old; who fought on the front lines in a vicious war.
3616,20200002,A brutal; tense and unforgiving film that achieves the highs in technicality by balancing it with a triumphant look at the bravery on the war-front.
3617,20200002,1917 ignores larger questions about war for something more personal and humanistic and George MacKay's excellent performance is key to this.
3618,20200002,Mendes has produced a thrillingly immersive movie... We might be even more involved in the soldiers' fates were we not also boggling over the staggering technical feats that went into the film's making.
3619,20200002,If Mendes' film-making has sometimes felt to have not fully outgrown his beginnings in theatre; 1917 is wildly cinematic; a movie that makes you feel the breath of mortality on your neck.
3620,20200002,1917's ambitious gambit soon becomes a double-edged sword: it brings us closer to these men; but sets them apart from the collective experiences it seeks to memorialise.
3621,20200002,"While Mendes didn't shrink from displaying the vivid imagination of a suburban horndog; he's unwilling to face the imagination of the valorous combatants of ""1917."""
3622,20200002,"From the sole perspective of the filmmaking craft; ""1917"" is worth a watch."
3623,20200002,It's a tense; unnerving ride that accomplishes its goal of translating the first-person experience of war better than any war movies that have come before it. It's a level up.
3624,20200002,The film is thrilling; moving on effectively from one shocking set piece to another; studding the narrative too with starry cameos.
3625,20200003,The film plays like a roller coaster; going through twists and turns that will leave you breathless.
3626,20200003,The truth is; we own nothing but ourselves and it's that which serves as a glorious jumping off point for writer/director Leigh Whannell's The Invisible Man remake; now available on home video.
3627,20200003,The Invisible Man is an effective horror thriller that utilizes outstanding special effects; a chilling storyline; and a strong performance from Elisabeth Moss.
3628,20200003,Proves an old classic can get dusted off to be a completely relevant and timely thriller that's worth seeing for a new generation.
3629,20200003,The most dazzling aspect of The Invisible Man is the long stretches of silence where the visual grammar forces viewers to really analyze what's happening in the frame.
3630,20200003,Never lives up to its magnificent opening sequence.
3631,20200003,A bracingly modern #MeToo allegory that; despite its brutal craft; rings hollow.
3632,20200003,Whannell is brilliant at distracting us with amusing; knowing dialogue (siblings are rivalrous; architects are trendy; waiters are irksomely urbane). Death comes when you least expect it.
3633,20200003,[Elizabeth Moss is] amazing and she does so much just with her eyes. It's a really demanding role physically [and] emotionally; it's a huge range she has to play.
3634,20200003,Ultimately; The Invisible Man makes for a pacey; if mostly predictable; reimagining of a classic Hollywood horror terror.
3635,20200003,The prize asset is Moss; of course; a seven-octave actor equally happy with micro-emotion and going very big indeed.
3636,20200003,There's a lot more to think about than a typical horror film. It's a real psychological thriller...a good strong film; not SCARY scary; but it gets in your head.
3637,20200004,It's a stand-out coming-of-age film.
3638,20200004,[A] brilliantly subtle slice-of-life drama about a young woman's rapidly shrinking rights over her own body.
3639,20200004,Like the grim flip-side of Juno; it can be a bleak watch; with no-one cracking a smile for a good 45 minutes; but it's a slowly rewarding one.
3640,20200004,"Anchored by two of the most natural performances from young actors in recent memory; Eliza Hittman's ""Never Rarely Sometimes Always"" might be the year's most impactful film."
3641,20200004,Without ever resorting to melodrama; writer-director Eliza Hittman has created a powerfully understated; quietly political and touchingly empathetic drama.
3642,20200004,Never Rarely Sometimes Always shows with such clarity that there is a world of women's stories existing underneath the surface that desperately need to be told.
3643,20200004,Its strength is in its restraint; and the way that it takes a situation; presents its characters and keeps things very; very real.
3644,20200004,You come away from this movie weeping for the Autumns of this world but also awed by their endurance.
3645,20200004,Never hints at the quiet; revolutionary nature of empathy and autonomy in empowering young women to keep themselves safe.
3646,20200004,[A] tough; realist drama...
3647,20200004,In Flanagan; the film has a first-time actor with a veteran's confidence in her own stillness.
3648,20200004,I'm not trying to downplay the emotional stuff. But there's a fine line between gruelling and gripping and Hittman is always on the right side of it.
3649,20200005,A Greek chorus of old salts singing sea shanties instantly dictates the quirky and corrosive mood of this fascinating Coen-like thriller. And to remind us all: Margo Martindale is a national treasure.
3650,20200005,I was in from the opening prelude; a quasi-Greek chorus of fishermen singing an old sea shanty; their great voices mixed with the musicality and rhythms of their tools and work.
3651,20200005,Salty; suspenseful; subtly droll; modern-day murder mystery; reminiscent of the Coen brothers' black comedy thrillers.
3652,20200005,Writer/directors Bridget Savage Cole and Danielle Krudy are like female Coen Brothers.
3653,20200005,This feminist film noir's beautiful and bleak cinematography; whip smart writing and quirky directing had me laughing; screaming and jumping until the end when all I wanted to do was celebrate and tell everyone to go see this film.
3654,20200005,An accomplished debut blending a Hitchcockian macabre sense of humor with a clockwork plot.
3655,20200005,"Which is fine; because the movie's pretty great - not quite ""Fargo"" with lobsters but close enough; and about as good as regional filmmaking gets."
3656,20200005,In its own gentle but sure-eyed way; this movie cuts deliciously deep.
3657,20200005,"""Blow the Man Down"" creates a well-realized world with layers that keep revealing themselves. You don't want to live there; but it's well worth a visit."
3658,20200005,I thought it had a very vivid sense of place... It has some smart dialogue and some very offbeat characters.
3659,20200005,It is really singular and unique and cool and strange and very ambitious.
3660,20200005,It's an incredibly cunning mystery with a charming cast of characters who ultimately crack under the pressure of keeping up with their appearances.
3661,20200006,Yes; it isn't really another WALL-E; Up; Inside Out or Coco but; then again; what is; kids?
3662,20200006,Onward gets its job done and presents themes and questions that are interesting to consider; and if it feels too ambitious for its own good; it's doing more than most of the other films currently in theatres.
3663,20200006,There's something about the character design; the voices; and the personality here that feels ... Dreamworks-y. That isn't a compliment. It feels sub-Shrek-ian.
3664,20200006,The underlying theme is the discovery of true brotherly friendship; love and support--how can you go wrong with that?
3665,20200006,We've sat through enough second-rate Pixar films to know how the studio is as susceptible to creative mediocrity as anybody else. So it comes as a heartening relief to behold Onward; a wildly imaginative; deeply enjoyable and ultimately moving tale.
3666,20200006,Disney-Pixar's magic-themed fantasy adventure delivers big laughs and little tears within its tale of fraternal love and moving beyond grief.
3667,20200006,A likable family comedy that finds an easy rhythm without effort.
3668,20200006,[Onward] feels frantically eager to please; until it tries to yank at your heartstrings in the by-now familiar formula of Pixar Animation.
3669,20200006,"There's something here for everyone; even if the overall package isn't likely to go down as the next Disney/Pixar ""classic."""
3670,20200006,Even mid-level Pixar still casts a spell.
3671,20200006,Do families need fathers? Scanlon delivers a love song to atypical clans; which couldn't end on a sweeter; or clearer; note.
3672,20200006,A very sweet story; good but not great...kids will love it.
3673,20200007,How does going to summer camp create a generation of activists? Like this.
3674,20200007,It visibilizes the history of one of the most invisibilized communities in this country.
3675,20200007,These are amazing people whose inner lights shine through their distorted bodies and often difficult speech.
3676,20200007,It's an exquisitely crafted documentary with humor and pathos that will forever change the way you look at sidewalk wheelchair ramps.
3677,20200007,Crip Camp is a revelation.
3678,20200007,"The film uses the word ""crip"" and reclaims it. By doing so; a pejorative is thus transformed into a badge; maybe of honor; certainly of power."
3679,20200007,Crip Camp conveys; as few films do; a sense of lives lived furiously and passionately across a vast stretch of time.
3680,20200007,[It] sounds as if it's going to be Good for You rather than good; but it actually turns out to be both - as well as surprising; which is surprising in itself; given that inspirational civil rights documentaries tend to be more alike than unalike.
3681,20200007,The riveting tale of a decades-long radical revolution that changed the world forever.
3682,20200007,"""Crip Camp"" shows change can come from anyone; anywhere at anytime. It's a lesson that should always be taken to heart but rings especially true now."
3683,20200007,Mostly; this is an empowering feel-good documentary about a small group of people who came together in the right place at the right time.
3684,20200007,How strange - and how telling - that despite the wealth of big-screen documentaries released in the past 20 years; the story behind the remarkable Crip Camp has gone so long untold.
3685,20200008,Sly; sharp; and snarkily underplayed; this instant little masterpiece of fantasy comedy is as occasionally shockingly horrific as it is nonstop shockingly funny; peopled with instant fast friends.
3686,20200008,...an irreverent; charming laugh-riot.
3687,20200008,This supernatural romantic comedy is; in a word; adorable. Much of that is due to the incredible charms of cowriter/star/Stephen Fry lookalike Maeve Higgins whose insecure and warm-hearted Rose is in a perpetual quest for romance and her next meal.
3688,20200008,So; you have a ghost story; a possibly budding romance; an exorcism; a light comedy and just a load of fun.
3689,20200008,To say that things get wackier after that is no exaggeration. The laughs far outweigh the scares and some of the scenes...
3690,20200008,Very funny off-beat Irish comedy.
3691,20200008,"Armed with wit and charm to spare; ""Extra Ordinary"" is joyful and creative and deserves to find an audience - in this world or the next."
3692,20200008,"While ""Extra Ordinary"" overextends its ghosts-are-blasé conceit; Higgins and Ward are appealing leads; and the movie has plenty of charming moments..."
3693,20200008,When Extra Ordinary finds the right wavelength for its wackiness; the script and the cast effectively straddle the line between gross-out gore and silly small-town melodrama.
3694,20200008,Like those cheeky genre-splicing comedies that came before it; the Ahern-Loughman collaboration doesn't merely goose the boundary between charming and outrageous; it gleefully tramples it into oblivion.
3695,20200008,For all the Blood Moon horror movie hijinks and unwelcome visitors from the beyond and from hell; Extra Ordinary is at heart a warm and inviting Comfort Food Movie...
3696,20200008,"""Extra Ordinary"" is an extraordinarily funny tale about ghostbusting; lonely hearts and moving on. It'll possess you."
3697,20200009,Not simply an exposé; the documentary implores its viewers to take action; shining a light on various grass-roots movements that have sprouted up in opposition to gerrymandering and the political hostage-taking that has resulted from it.
3698,20200009,Slay the Dragon isn't a glorified PowerPoint presentation about the history of voting. It's an unabashed activist documentary aimed at convincing viewers they can fight gerrymandering in their home states.
3699,20200009,If you're a political junkie; this is a must see film.
3700,20200009,Use of animations here are sleek and unlike other docs feel entirely necessary in dissecting how neighbours on the opposite of the street can be divided by race; income; gender and any number of other factors....
3701,20200009,A film that needs to be shown in classrooms. An important treatise on gerrymandering; which may be the central injustice of our time.
3702,20200009,This is the best primer on political gerrymandering imaginable and should be mandatory viewing in grad school public policy symposiums and high school civics classes alike.
3703,20200009,[A] compelling and instructive look at the political practice of gerrymandering.
3704,20200009,Goodman and Durrance have made a dense; numbers-driven subject very accessible.
3705,20200009,This film is absolutely infuriating and it is must-see viewing.
3706,20200009,It's a terrific film. I was a little wary that it going to be really wonky; which it sort of is; but it is also extremely well-edited... and it's even-handed.
3707,20200009,While it doesn't exactly bring new information to the table; the movie provides a welcome breakdown of the dramatic impact that gerrymandering has across American society whenever election season comes around.
3708,20200009,"Gerrymandering is purposely confusing. Even its name is wonky. But the compelling; impassioned documentary ""Slay the Dragon"" does an effective job of explaining it..."
3709,20200010,This is absolutely valuable work; not just in terms of its subject matter; but also in how the discussion is framed with historical context.
3710,20200010,The powerful yet infuriating film not only recounts decades-old confrontations in disturbing detail; but incisively examines a broader stigma.
3711,20200010,Nothing is more powerful here than hearing these black women detail how a variety of societal norms failed them; and how they navigate the world through different shades of skin colour...
3712,20200010,Has an understanding of the courage it takes for a woman; especially a person of color; to expose the ugly truth of sexual assault and harassment in the workplace.
3713,20200010,On the Record recognizes and reminds us that the true loss we're made aware of by #MeToo isn't the careers of famous men cut short by accusations; it's the careers and contributions of the many; many women whose names we may never know.
3714,20200010,On the Record becomes an immediate part of the canon of films about gender and racial oppression and violence in the United States today.
3715,20200010,The film communicates... complex ideas with quiet; forceful emotional clarity.
3716,20200010,Beyond laying out the accusations against Simmons; On the Record is a deeply mournful portrait of lost potential; of a woman run out of a business that she not only loved; but helped create.
3717,20200010,Despite its faults; On the Record is a necessary social document.
3718,20200010,I admire the different tangents that this film goes down... There's a lot here to chew on.
3719,20200010,This is so compelling. It's intimate... But I think what really makes it particularly interesting is how it shines a light on an aspect of the #MeToo movement that we haven't really seen.
3720,20200010,The rare #MeToo documentary that grapples frankly with its accusers' uncertainty about coming forward.
3721,20200011,Its crescendo goes nowhere near an explosive statement. But this small movie portrays a tense reality that should never be denied. [Full review in Spanish].
3722,20200011,An important and strong contribution that leaves you deeply affected and angry. [Full review in Spanish]
3723,20200011,How did men like Weinstein get away with it for so long? The Assistant counts the ways; while making it clear that many still do.
3724,20200011,Garner plays a recent college graduate working for a nameless; faceless movie mogul. The film spends just one day with her at the office; but it packs the punch of an entire lifetime.
3725,20200011,[A] quietly chilling drama for the era of #MeToo and Time's Up.
3726,20200011,[Julia Garner] carries the role on her young (and very talented) shoulders. [Full review in Spanish]
3727,20200011,"You leave ""The Assistant"" thinking about why some of us are invisible and some of us don't notice - and about how evil lives in the places from which we look away."
3728,20200011,Green; the first filmmaker to give narrative voice to this subject; posits her day in the life of a witness to workplace gangrene as a grueling example of cinema as frustration.
3729,20200011,It is a sombre; realist study of what day-by-day; moment-by-moment abuse actually looks like.
3730,20200011,The whole point of Green's film is the routine; submerged; and invisible quality of its horrors: you can readily believe Tuesday might be even worse.
3731,20200011,Required viewing for every person in a job with an in-built power structure.
3732,20200011,After a while; the question becomes not just what kind of industry allowed this to happen; but how many people still working in it now looked the other way.
3733,20200012,Kelly Reichardt's most tonally sophisticated film to date -- a bittersweet frontier portrait of a close; strong; and soothingly uncomplicated male friendship.
3734,20200012,"Gentle; evocative; and bearing Reichardt's signature contemplative pacing; ""First Cow"" is one of the richest; best films of 2020."
3735,20200012,This is one of the gentlest Westerns I've seen in a long time.
3736,20200012,As with Meek's Cutoff; First Cow is a Western that chips away at myth; and wrestles power and history away from the lone-white-cowboy archetype.
3737,20200012,Feeling both exquisitely believable and unnervingly real; the action builds from a restrained tension to outright confrontation.
3738,20200012,Forget your mantra. Watching First Cow is a form of meditation.
3739,20200012,"""First Cow"" is the real thing; a genuine work of art. But for too much of its running time; it's agonizingly slow; and the story is almost entirely without suspense."
3740,20200012,Think of it more as one of those examples of how you can learn more from fiction than fact; because the movie tells us a lot about the origins of a nascent culture - country; really (ours); and the people within it (us).
3741,20200012,We might go into a Kelly Reichardt movie thinking we'll be told a story; but we emerge with our consciousness subtly and radically altered.
3742,20200012,"""First Cow"" is as confident and organic as storytelling gets - as rough-edged as it is in style; it's absurdly rich in ripple effect."
3743,20200012,First Cow is especially accomplished in its aesthetic...
3744,20200012,A small story [that] also inspires awe.
3745,20200013,Vitalina Varela is essential filmmaking from an essential filmmaker; and maybe the way Costa and Varela explore grief's every nook and cranny will yield unexpected relief from our own.
3746,20200013,Masterful cinema and a no holds barred lesson about people who are counted out and find hope in themselves.
3747,20200013,Vitalina Varela isn't going to be for everyone as a result. It might be slow moving; but it's emotionally profound.
3748,20200013,It feels strange to say that Vitalina Varela is a visually stunning film because what it depicts is an ugly failing of people. It's a film submerged in regret; remorse; anger; and in some ways a faint light of hope (but just faint).
3749,20200013,The film; shot almost entirely at night by cinematographer Leonardo Simões; is breathtakingly beautiful...In one beautiful bit of alchemy; clothespins appear as raised praying hands over black cloaks which dance as Vitalina edges past them.
3750,20200013,If you can give two hours of your existence to a dark room and sincere thought; there's nothing more essential available right now.
3751,20200013,A breathtakingly gorgeous movie about love; death; and immigration.
3752,20200013,Costa rejects voyeurism and condescension in favor of a form of storytelling solidarity with his actors; one where there's no buffer of irony; no distancing effects.
3753,20200013,Rich; mysterious; rigorous and generous.
3754,20200013,Costa remains a master of digital chiaroscuro; of political ghost stories - and of the lives other films leave outside the frame.
3755,20200013,Almost all of the film takes place at night; except the very end; when there is daylight and even sunlight. The result is weirdly moving.
3756,20200013,Vitalina Varela is demanding; rewarding; and ineffably stirring.
3757,20200014,Corpus Christi is a movie worth discovering...
3758,20200014,Bartosz Bielenia and director Jan Komasa spin an inspirational tale and a tense countdown.
3759,20200014,Shooting in beautifully composed 2.39 : 1 widescreen; director of photography Piotr Sobocinski Jr. favors the greens of rebirth accented by Madonna hued bluesBielenia is perfectly cast; his cinematic face capable of appearing both demonic and angelic
3760,20200014,It's not just an answer to a prayer; it's a miracle.
3761,20200014,While it's not an easy watch; Jan Komasa's film is an emotional powerhouse that will leave viewers rattled.
3762,20200014,By the end; Komasa tries too hard to convince us how important and sober his film is; even if its critiques are valid.
3763,20200014,[I]t deviates enough from formula-especially in its arresting ending; which takes full advantage of Bielenia's haunted visage-to be worth seeing.
3764,20200014,This is a movie that wants you to think about what redemption really means. And it has a lead... [that's] your new Hot Priest; Eastern European Division.
3765,20200014,Directed by Jan Komasa in only his third feature and starring a complexly compelling Bartosz Bielenia; this is a blistering drama; intense; disturbing and inescapably thought-provoking; a film that gets its power from a merging of potent opposites.
3766,20200014,I really like this film... Beautifully shot.
3767,20200014,"A quite interesting and irresistible movie; a sort of cross between Paul Schrader's recent film of spiritual crisis; ""First Reformed;"" and Spielberg's ""Catch Me If You Can."""
3768,20200014,"Even when events get intense; even violent; and they do; there's nothing abrupt. ""Corpus Christi"" never erupts. It unfolds."
3769,20200015,Sokolov and his team seem to be students of the craft; and it's an absolute blast seeing them bash their way through the walls of Russian cinema to make something of their own.
3770,20200015,Nothing more than a smirking; sardonically grisly game; but on that admittedly low level; it works.
3771,20200015,A rip-roaring; bloody slice of Russian genre cinema that combines a tightly plotted narrative with a stylish command of craft to hugely entertaining; immersive effect.
3772,20200015,Offering wall-to-wall gore and super-stylised visuals; this bloody chamber piece is not for the squeamish.
3773,20200015,Kirill Sokolov's debut feature Why Don't You Just Die! demonstrates that same energy and spark found within Pulp Fiction; with added live-action cartoon levels of violence and humour.
3774,20200015,[W]hen a filmmaker uses the limitations to their advantage to create an incredible blend of action; comedy and dark twisted humour that rivals that of any big studio production; you have one hell of a film on your hands.
3775,20200015,Why Don't You Just Die! is an accomplished film that makes the very most of its limited sets; without seeming constricted or stagey.
3776,20200015,Why Don't You Just Die! is stylish enough; but it's rarely as clever as it is busy.
3777,20200015,Sokolov's debut feature is a clever; bloody as hell; often hilarious virtuoso exercise in excruciating harm-doing among mendacious people.
3778,20200015,"""Why Don't You Just Die!"" is too cartoonish and glib to have much to say about Russia or about genre films in general. But it is stylish and snazzy - a confident throwback to the knowing exploitation pictures of yesteryear."
3779,20200015,When the viscera is flying; this approach works beautifully; even when you're watching Matvey get brutalized through hands clasped over your eyes; you're still watching.
3780,20200015,It's simultaneously so bloody and gory; but there is a simplicity and a playfulness to the structure... A lot of fun; but definitely not for the squeamish.
3781,20200016,The Half of It doesn't depend on love; or its characters to save each other. It allows them to make decisions for themselves; and become whole instead of waiting on the other half. That in itself is a bold stroke if there ever was one.
3782,20200016,The Half of It is beautiful; stirring; and emotional; and certainly worth a watch.
3783,20200016,Wu does a lot of work in this film with various themes. She doesn't care about the storybook ending that some viewers may have been dying for - she chooses something much more real.
3784,20200016,All three characters...bring a realism to the traditional teen romance that reminds audiences that sometimes; the happily ever after can be delivered in a different way. And in the case of The Half of It; it makes it all the sweeter.
3785,20200016,Compassionate and emotionally universal; Alice Wu's film understands several very particular teen experience: Falling in love; adolescent dignity; and thinking you're the only brain in town.
3786,20200016,There's a generosity of spirit here that is increasingly a feature of teenage dramas as writers and directors move away from stereotypes to more complex characters.
3787,20200016,Wu is confident enough to make the bold strokes her characters speak of and craft a movie that's comfortably different.
3788,20200016,A prickly-tender film about teenage friendship; first love and all the blurry gradations in between. It's sweet and funny; but also; in places; as raw as a scraped knee.
3789,20200016,Smart; charming and endlessly refreshing.
3790,20200016,By exploring issues of race and queerness with emotional complexity; it treats teenagers with the sophistication they deserve.
3791,20200016,It's so tenderhearted and transporting; its characters so likable; that you can't help but want to give the movie and everyone in it a big hug.
3792,20200016,If The Half of It lacks the pizzazz and energy of similar Netflix fare; and doesn't have much to say beyond its initial setup; it at least takes a stab at doing something different.
3793,20200017,In many ways; Richard Wong's first feature is a lovely film.
3794,20200017,A surprise raunchy comedy that made it out of the early '00s to freshen up the modern comedic landscape. Insanely charming performances from everyone involved.
3795,20200017,In inviting us to experience both the joy and pain these characters encounter; it provides the jolt the road-trip-comedy model so desperately needs.
3796,20200017,Watching these four is hilarious as genuine friendships form and vulnerabilities are revealed with compassion; wit; a fair amount of insight; and no small amount of skill.The film also skillfully avoids cheap sentiment; no small feat here.
3797,20200017,Not only is the film a crowd pleaser; it's a reminder to always live life to the fullest no matter what obstacles you're dealt along the way.
3798,20200017,What a sweet; surprisingly funny buddy road trip of three men with disabilities hell bent on losing their virginity. This film is enlightening; respectful and smart.
3799,20200017,The candor with which Erik Linthorst's script regards the characters' sexual desires - coupled with the winning performances of the actors - leavens any sentimentalism.
3800,20200017,From its safe casting to the optics of Scotty's apparent white-male aggression among characters of color; Wong seems to be urging the audience to overlook its more tone-deaf messages for the sake of disability visibility-which it only halfway celebrates.
3801,20200017,"At once frank; tender and unapologetically funny; ""Come as You Are"" is a sweet surprise."
3802,20200017,Its script's approach to disability steers clear of some common cinematic pitfalls; and; whatever its flaws; it has a fine time making points that will be obvious to most in the audience.
3803,20200017,You might be genuinely moved; and even in tears by the end of Richard Wong's imperfect yet gradually disarming dramedy.
3804,20200017,Shot in Illinois; the charmer about men with disabilities earns its laughs and tears.
3805,20200018,What follows is a treat of a heist film only made more charming by the unexpected hilarity of Chin's performance.
3806,20200018,Tsai Chin gives Grandma a gruff; unflappable exterior; but also shows the years of heartache that made her that way - while also slowly; gradually; revealing the tenderness within that shell.
3807,20200018,What's most unexpected for Sealy's film is the subtlety of Chin's performance... Tsai Chin's performance is one of small gestures and facial tics; which commands the screen in what could have been forgettable or frivolous.
3808,20200018,A pleasantly minor crime comedy rooted in a strong lead performance by Tsai Chin.
3809,20200018,Lucky Grandma is a taut; snappily-edited noir; directed by Sasie Sealy from a script she wrote with Angela Cheng.
3810,20200018,Rarely turning her camera's gaze away from the formidable Wong; director Sealy situates her protagonist in a Chinatown brimming with inviting cultural and social details.
3811,20200018,Plot aside; the movie belongs to 86-year-old Chin whose portrayal of a chainsmoking grandma is not to be missed.
3812,20200018,The fusion of Andrew Orkin's score and Eduardo Enrique Mayén's cinematography; which coats everything in the grimy yellow of a lifelong smoker's room; tips the hat towards noir; but Sealy balances that with a deft wit and charm
3813,20200018,It's got some of the snap of Guy Ritchie's Lock; Stock and Two Smoking Barrels; but it's sweet and funny too.
3814,20200018,Multi-award-winning director Sasie Sealy does a terrific job in her first feature film. [Full review in Spanish]
3815,20200018,Sasie Sealy's feature debut is a stylish one that moves fluidly from casino tables to gang shootouts in and around New York's Chinatown.
3816,20200018,Lucky Grandma suffers from some pacing issues but nevertheless tells a gripping and compelling story further boosted by the talent of lead star Tsai Chin.
3817,20200019,"The success of ""The Vast of Night"" lies on its lo-fi but high-concept premise that breaks the convention of a sci-fi movie involving strange things happen in a small town."
3818,20200019,The Vast of Night consistently entertains; and its mixture of vintage aesthetics and spooky subject matter feels like the beginning of the summer movie season.
3819,20200019,A wonderful sci-fi time capsule that's a 50s radio show brought to life.
3820,20200019,Unfortunately; the film is all beautiful shots and stunning sound design but none of the magnetic character or intriguing story.
3821,20200019,It's hard to remember the last time a micro-budgeted indie movie by a first-time director made as much of an impression
3822,20200019,The Vast of Night is an ambitious first film for director Andrew Patterson as he tackles the stylish genre piece. It's clearly an homage to The Twilight Zone and Steven Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind.
3823,20200019,"What really makes ""The Vast of Night"" work isn't the film's climax - which is fine and creepy; if more obviously hampered by budget limitations - but the two main characters and the dynamic that grows up between them."
3824,20200019,It's a stark reminder that ideas are more important than production budgets in crafting compelling science fiction.
3825,20200019,It is very low-key and obviously extremely low-budget; but also stylish and clever.
3826,20200019,It's remarkably sharp; funny; and ominous. A terrific debut.
3827,20200019,This witty and audacious sci-fi mystery arrives like a persistent and unexplained radar-bleep from the heavens: low-budget; high-concept.
3828,20200019,Working with a minuscule budget; Patterson pulls off a feat as amazing as any flying saucer.
3829,20200020,It's a knockout.
3830,20200020,[A] strange; delicately made film; which manages to defy expectations about both of its subjects and the power balance between them.
3831,20200020,One leaves The Painter and the Thief feeling eager to see what might happen if we were kinder and less self-interested; and convinced anew of the basic connection between paint and the human heart.
3832,20200020,Frequently blurring the line between artist and subject; The Painter and the Thief is an absorbing work.
3833,20200020,The film's title hints at both fairy tale and Bible story; and both elements are present in director Benjamin Ree's compelling portrait of two seemingly different people drawn together through the redemptive power of art.
3834,20200020,Director Benjamin Ree presents an astounding portrait of forgiveness and empathy.
3835,20200020,Both [Barbora and Karl-Bertil] are open books; and open wounds.
3836,20200020,It's a movie about how art can change people's lives for better and worse; altering our perspectives of ourselves and the world around us. But it's also about how such work isn't created in a vacuum.
3837,20200020,Compelling.
3838,20200020,Ask not-or not only-what the painter does for the thief. Ask what the thief might be doing for the painter.
3839,20200020,The concept of being seen through someone else's eyes drives the best parts of The Painter and the Thief; a documentary that illuminates a great deal about the human condition even if it does kind of fizzle out in the third act.
3840,20200020,[T]here are moments so intimate and unguarded that you may briefly dissociate and question what you're watching - a documentary; or its carefully scripted and acted narrative counterpart.
3841,20200021,I was delighted throughout.
3842,20200021,A sly; clever; and funny animated film. ... A sheer delight.
3843,20200021,You can see the major twists and emotional beats coming from a mile away; but that's part of Farmageddon's soothing charm; too: You don't have to worry too much when things look dire; because you know it'll all turn out okay in the end.
3844,20200021,Shaun's new film is for the whole family to enjoy. [Full review in Spanish]
3845,20200021,"Like ""Shaun the Sheep Movie""; the sequel retains most of the same family-friendly British charm and slapstick antics that runs at a breezy 86 minutes."
3846,20200021,Charming and well-animated; but unlikely to engage anyone over the age of 7.
3847,20200021,But all that Farmageddon delivers is a not-unpleasant distraction for a cold; lazy afternoon.
3848,20200021,It's a very funny movie - and an endlessly; refreshingly cheerful one; which is just as rare.
3849,20200021,A quick-witted and uproarious homage to the sci-fi genre like only the stop-motion geniuses at Aardman Animations could imagine and handcraft..
3850,20200021,If you like anything Aardman; or anything funny really; you should make an effort to find it.
3851,20200021,That all these characters and then some have distinct personalities is all the more remarkable because no one uses actual words; instead making do quite nicely with assorted grunts; groans and indefinable grumbles.
3852,20200021,Farmageddon made me laugh quite a few times; and kids will probably love it. But it can't quite measure up to the glories of the first Shaun the Sheep film.
3853,20200022,Whoever thought an abortion would be a background source for redemption? Director Alex Thompson's eye for fluidity in story telling is a major asset; in a humanist take on the karma of our life choices. A blessing of a film.
3854,20200022,Pushes the gross-out envelope further than most woman-centric movies without losing its charm.
3855,20200022,Pleasingly frank and nonjudgmental indie queer parenting comedy.
3856,20200022,O'Sullivan's script knows when to press and when to pull back; and the entire cast is beautifully comfortable in director Thompson's hands.
3857,20200022,A bizarrely ineffective and uneven movie.
3858,20200022,A story as messy and unclear as the protagonist; Saint Frances gives an honest portrayal of a life in flux.
3859,20200022,"""Saint Frances"" hits a sweet spot that's really sweet."
3860,20200022,I liked its ability to tackle potentially tricky and weighty subjects with really refreshing honesty and a matter-of-fact nature.
3861,20200022,By the end; the authenticity of their bond feels so well-earned that you might not mind watching another movie about them growing up with each other.
3862,20200022,Kelly O'Sullivan writes and stars in the small masterpiece that's both thought-provoking and wildly entertaining.
3863,20200022,The feminism comes with wry twists in a film that's alive at every moment to the meaning of family in all its configurations; and to the self-doubts; uncertainties; and joys of growing up female.
3864,20200022,What looks like a throwaway about a precocious kid and her nanny is actually one of the best and gutsiest movies you'll find anywhere these pandemic days-a fun-time trailblazer that retains its rough edges to that last. It's some kind of miracle.
3865,20200023,It's nostalgic yet hip; fresh and informative. But it is built for fans only...
3866,20200023,This has obviously been made for fans; but even if you're unfamiliar with the Beastie Boys; it's impossible not to be entertained by these irrepressible showmen.
3867,20200023,I came away from it wishing the Beastie Boys were my friends; and feeling glad they still care for each other.
3868,20200023,It's an exhilarating ride; full of insight; humour and contrition.
3869,20200023,"Even as a fan; ""Beastie Boys Story"" is a revelation. From the baseline of their hardcore roots; their discovery of early hip-hop and the evolution of a sound that's still so uniquely their own; it's a musical document."
3870,20200023,Playing like a TED Talk; we live vicariously through the energetic stories of Mike D and Ad-Rock in this live documentary.
3871,20200023,The Beastie Boys story is simply too big; too strange; too unwieldy for Beastie Boys Story to contain it.
3872,20200023,It creates a welcome level of irony and mild self-laceration not normally found in the traditional (aka obsequious) music documentary.
3873,20200023,Beastie Boys Story is bittersweet more than sad; and doesn't dwell on what-ifs. Instead; the documentary celebrates a singular group that never lost their desire to innovate; create and become better people.
3874,20200023,Despite the relatively staid format; it still manages to be a lively and occasionally touching journey through success and failure; artistry and excess; industrial-strength brattiness and even a bit of hard-earned wisdom.
3875,20200023,Beastie Boys Story is a tribute to that transformation; a movie about American masculinity and the delicate art of repenting in public.
3876,20200023,It's all pretty straightforward. But Diamond and Horowitz are great storytellers - no surprise there - and Jonze adds video clips and photos on the giant screen behind them (and makes the occasional mistake; played for laughs).
3877,20200024,The cast is mostly spot-on; with Margot Robbie steals most of the show with her gleefully unhinged performance as Harley Quinn.
3878,20200024,Sputters to the finish line with its disjointed pacing; it's a damn good time with some dazzling fight scenes; dark humor; and a banner turn by Robbie.
3879,20200024,This is right here; bizarre; bonkers; bloody and brutal fun.
3880,20200024,Robbie's Harley Quinn is best deployed in small doses. By placing her front and centre; in a film that teases a more communal feminine interest; her unceasing penchant for the overzealous quickly becomes exhausting.
3881,20200024,A wild and wacky; candy-coated; glitter-filled grimy ride through the streets of Gotham with the motliest crew of characters as we explore themes of camaraderie; partnership; and female empowerment.
3882,20200024,There may not be too many surprises; but Yan has announced herself as a creative force to be reckoned with.
3883,20200024,You don't have to choose between Scorsese and superheroes. Let go of the guilt. Feel free to embrace these lesser spotted birds.
3884,20200024,"""Birds of Prey"" wants to fly high; powered by its own wild child; rule-breaking spirit. The truth is it never gets off the ground."
3885,20200024,It offers a hundred different versions of Robbie gurning to camera - usually after bashing someone's head in with a baseball bat - and not a single moment to elevate the proceedings above a scrappy; screechy; second-rate cartoon hotchpotch.
3886,20200024,A bone-cracking visual feast; filled with screen-popping sets and costumes; enough hand-to-hand combat scenes to make Jason Statham seethe with envy; and a fantastic ensemble cast...
3887,20200024,[Margot Robbie] herself is fantastic. The action choreography is pretty good... If I have a quibble: it has probably the worst needle drops of any movie in recent history.
3888,20200024,Under the film's hyper-formatted style and impersonal action; there's a pretty good movie straining to break out-which makes the waste of its creators' earnest exertions all the more dismaying.
3889,20200025,BLOOD ON HER NAME is a New American Gothic treasure that keeps viewers captivated from start to finish with its full circle tale.
3890,20200025,Blood on Her Name is a sleek indie thriller with dread that just constantly churns throughout its breezy runtime...smart and heart-wrenching.
3891,20200025,sharply focused thriller... The main character's ambiguity is the biggest draw. Is she a victim or a villain? We don't really know and Bethany Anne Lind does a great job at keeping the audience guessing.
3892,20200025,Thoughtful; precise; and filled with foreboding; Blood on Her Name is a pulp-noir thriller of the highest caliber.
3893,20200025,They have structured this story in such a way that the final product is a seven-layer cake - so delicious through the last bite.
3894,20200025,A crime thriller that for once puts the interplay of characters to the fore-front; Blood on Her Name is an assured debut from Matthew Pope.
3895,20200025,...unexpected; morally complex; and alive with tension.
3896,20200025,"Oppressively dark and unrelentingly intense; ""Blood on Her Name"" packs down-and-dirty performances; and a few surprises; into a tight 85 minutes."
3897,20200025,"""Blood on Her Name"" runs out of juice ""So now what's"" by its final stretch. But Lind is terrific throughout; and it's a welcome change of pace to see a story about lawbreakers where no one involved is any kind of psychopath or super-crook."
3898,20200025,A desperate woman's good intentions make a bad situation much worse in this tense and twisty Southern noir thriller.
3899,20200025,Allowing the viewer to piece things together on their own is always welcome; but the film's desire to surprise and outwit makes it contrived.
3900,20200025,"Anchored by a magnetic performance from Bethany Anne Lind (""Ozark"") who is in nearly every scene; ""Blood on Her Name"" is an engrossing exercise in Southern neo-noir that doesn't waste a moment of its marathon-runner lean 83 minutes."
3901,20200026,It's a truly sincere; heartfelt retelling of Dickens' story; one that taps into a new contemporary edge and presents itself in a distinctly cinematic fashion; even if the storytelling falters along the way.
3902,20200026,It looks lovely; it's well acted and it's genuinely funny. It's also very rushed; has a weak script and loses most of the original stories heart.
3903,20200026,What really makes it spark as brightly as it does is the cast who weave those words into gold.
3904,20200026,Perhaps in order to save Dickens from himself Iannucci has given us a thoroughly colourblind David Copperfield; in which the lead role is played by Anglo-Indian; Dev Patel.
3905,20200026,Featuring split-screen sections à la Brian De Palma; and sped-up bits à la Benny Hill; it all passes in too much of a blur for the drama or any of Dickens' politic points to properly land.
3906,20200026,A fresh-yet-faithful take on Dickens' semi-autobiographical 19th classic.
3907,20200026,The script feels like it was tested in a wind tunnel - while the use of farce as the plot's default register makes a virtue of the rush to get through everything that remains.
3908,20200026,Also; Dickens's female characters are much improved; so all hail this showcase for the talent of Iannucci; a sly reminder that it's possible to be both a national treasure and a thorn in the establishment's side.
3909,20200026,Needed to be fresh and fun to justify its existence and it is; often thanks to that scorching ensemble cast.
3910,20200026,If one scene could capture the whole movie; it would be Patel emerging from the Trotwood residence laden with pots and pans; bellowing and clattering to scare a passing donkey. We are all that donkey.
3911,20200026,Still; the film ultimately lives or dies on the strength of its central performance. And in Patel's hands it's a thing of beauty. You've got to love him.
3912,20200026,A vivacious adaptation of the Charles Dickens classic; this is as wide-eyed and open-hearted as they come.
3913,20200027,The strange but compelling Bacurau; plunging us into the hinterlands of Brazil; is the kind of modern-day Western that Sam Peckinpah might have made if he were a) Brazilian and b) alive.
3914,20200027,[Bacurau] a brutally unhinged B-movie that turns the western genre on its head to give a truly thrilling cinema experience that harkens back to the idiocentric aesthetics of Robert Rodriguez and the over-the-top bloodshed of a Quentin Tarantino film.
3915,20200027,Mendonça and Dornelles's film is... an attempt to grapple with unspeakable; horrifying evil -- but an evil that must be understood in social and historical rather than biblical terms.
3916,20200027,The way this film's story develops - well; I wasn't surprised at all when Udo Kier appeared on the scene.
3917,20200027,The editing and the way the film is put together have a bit of a graphic novel vibe [and] it works very well with the tone and shotmaking. Extremely effective.
3918,20200027,At times brilliant; at times grotesque. [Full review in Spanish]
3919,20200027,[T]he endeavour quickly degenerates into a gory and increasingly alienating splatter-filled shoot'em-up.
3920,20200027,"For a fascinating hour or so; ""Bacurau"" ushers us into this strange; forbidding yet vibrant part of a world gone to hell."
3921,20200027,You never know where this movie is going. It is dreamlike for a long time and then it just becomes stunningly; graphically violent. You're laughing at moments that maybe you shouldn't be. It's really vivid; really odd; and unlike anything else.
3922,20200027,This movie gets a lot of points for being strange and Sônia Braga is all out as an alcoholic doctor.
3923,20200027,It resonates. And despite the beauty of the weathered local faces this movie celebrates; it resonates for anyone; anywhere; watching it.
3924,20200027,It's a rallying cry against structural injustice told through a satisfying blend of western and science fiction influences.
3925,20200028,Ordinary Love almost prides itself on avoiding sentimentality while still being a deeply emotional experience.
3926,20200028,Tremors of anger and annoyance run just below the surface [because] not even the purest love can evade humanity's inherently [fear-driven] messiness.
3927,20200028,"Puts the ""social"" in socialized medicine."
3928,20200028,What elevates it...is its focus on how a married couple can be battered by the ordeal; and yet find a way to overcome it by blending humor; hostility and love.
3929,20200028,Finding humor in unexpected places; this is a truly beautiful romance that points at the necessity of grace when faced with adversities.
3930,20200028,There is nothing ordinary about this film or the gifted actress who anchors it.
3931,20200028,"""Ordinary Love"" is not a movie solely about cancer. It is a raw; on-screen adaptation of what hundreds of couples experience when their limits are tested - physically; mentally and romantically."
3932,20200028,It's a bit like having a front row seat at being human.
3933,20200028,But here's the thing: Joan and Tom do come back from it. The couples who stay together figure out how to do that. Ordinary Love is an argument that; as hard as that is; it's worth it.
3934,20200028,Despite strong performances by Lesley Manville and Liam Neeson; the domestic drama offers little beyond recounting the steps of diagnosis and treatment.
3935,20200028,An engaging and well-acted drama that finds catharsis and hope in a terrible personal ordeal.
3936,20200028,This is a movie about resignation and perseverance and the non-showy essence of life and love.
3937,20200029,All the characters have funny foibles; and themes of kindness; forgiveness; generosity; and love abound to offset the selfishness of the rising British upper class.
3938,20200029,This Emma is best considered as a magical sojourn to a dreamscape unbound by any semblance of reality. It is mprobable and beguiling throughout.
3939,20200029,Through a delightful combination of sight; sound; and performance; de Wilde's EMMA. is a premier scruples comedy of the highest order and is available now on home video for endless enjoyment.
3940,20200029,"""Emma."" is as much a sweetly funny romantic comedy as it is an utter delight for your eyes."
3941,20200029,Dripping in vibrant colours; everything from the lush art direction to elegant costume design pops off the screen.
3942,20200029,While this may not quite match the vibrancy of the 1996 version; it certainly equals it in its emotional reach.
3943,20200029,Love may or may not make the world go round; but Austen's trick - repeated here by de Wilde - is in making us believe; for a minute; that matters of the heart matter more than anything else on Earth.
3944,20200029,The romantic tension builds nicely in a lush-looking new adaptation.
3945,20200029,"It takes a while for ""Emma."" to find its groove but once it gets there it's a delight. The source material is too good to disappoint."
3946,20200029,Emma is such a complete character that those around her often pale; but de Wilde's casting is downright vivacious.
3947,20200029,There's a real energy to this adaptation.
3948,20200029,The movie is handsomely mounted and consistently engaging. Yes; the story is familiar but part of the charm is seeing how key scenes have been re-envisioned by the filmmakers.
3949,20200030,These are meaty topics that make Just Mercy a frequently hard watch ... but because where Just Mercy leaves its audience emotionally is very much relevant today.
3950,20200030,Just Mercy features a trio of fine performances from its excellent cast; but thanks to a very by-the-numbers approach to its overly-familiar story; it ends up being a rather standard and forgettable procedural.
3951,20200030,Based on a true story and a real man in Bryan Stevenson; the film is as powerful as this man's conviction.
3952,20200030,Simply told with limited theatrics and anchored by some weighty vulnerable performances; Just Mercy is an excellent watch.
3953,20200030,The resulting movie is a very well assembled cinematic mediocrity.
3954,20200030,Just Mercy captures Bryan Stevenson's story for posterity's sake. We shall never forget.
3955,20200030,Jordan... has steel and energy in his part; and... Foxx... gives a beautifully modulated; unflashy and quietly moving performance; easily his best in at least a decade.
3956,20200030,[I]t's never less than engrossing. Even with the schmaltz.
3957,20200030,Still; by the time you reach the end - and realise how closely the film-makers have stuck to the facts - you won't care. That the truth will out is entertainment enough.
3958,20200030,Jordan; however; is completely persuasive. The virtues possessed by Stevenson are all on the quiet side. His analytical flair is matched by his patience; his tenacity and his acuity.
3959,20200030,"It's good acting at its finest in this preaching to the choir ""right to life"" drama that might have worked had the filmmakers chosen to show the audience a little mercy by not constantly talking down to them."
3960,20200030,It's steady and clear-headed; safe in the knowledge that truth is the ultimate humaniser.
3961,20200031,The third act climax is when the tensions rise and the drama that has been building up very slowly but surely finally gets unleashed via a fury of psychological and physical violence.
3962,20200031,A slow-burning and intimate thriller about grief; commanded by Ingvar Sigurdsson's marvelous performance. [Full Review in Spanish]
3963,20200031,A dream that; at the end; finally; we have the chance to question directly. [Full Review in Spanish]
3964,20200031,This is one of those intensely intimate movies that I wish I had been able to see on a large screen. When properly done; as it is here; the larger the screen; the more visceral the quiet spaces.
3965,20200031,A frosty breath of fresh air.
3966,20200031,A stark; controlled psychological thriller that unpicks its hero's troubled soul with forensic coolness.
3967,20200031,Palmason boldly risks audience disenfranchisement by pushing his disturbing story to unexpected lengths dramatically and stylistically; thereby winning a creative wrestling match with a potentially intransigent narrative.
3968,20200031,What's striking about A White; White Day is the way that Pálmason juxtaposes symbolic abstraction like that with acute psychological detail.
3969,20200031,An eerily gripping study of grief - and impotence in its face - with the trappings of a revenge thriller.
3970,20200031,It sometimes feels like Palmason is being a bit self-indulgent with his slow pace; but Ingvar Sigurdsson keeps the film grounded; and ends it with such a devastating; powerful final shot that it alone erases most criticisms.
3971,20200031,It's full of closely observed faces and majestically framed landscapes; and it lurches from tense revenge-thriller twists into haunting flights of abstraction.
3972,20200031,Riveting and quietly funny from scene to scene. It has this quiet sense of control... It's such a talent behind the lens that you become drawn into this film.
3973,20200032,The frustrating part of this documentary is it is so safe!
3974,20200032,So why watch Becoming? For the simple reason that her life story resounds with hope for a better tomorrow; which starts by telling one's story.
3975,20200032,"""Becoming"" is still a quietly informative; uplifting film."
3976,20200032,You feel a connection with Michelle Obama. She reminds us that you don't have to be the loudest one in the room or even the nastiest one to be heard. It's what we need to hear right now.
3977,20200032,Watching a young black girl; giddy as she imitates the former First Lady's walk down a hall; we get the sense that the mere experience of being in the same space as Obama will change some of these girls forever. They light up the screen.
3978,20200032,If you're looking for something to watch to make you feel like the world will get better and that there's hope; watch Becoming.
3979,20200032,If you loved the book; then you're going to love the movie... I found myself watching the film with a big; goofy grin most of the time.
3980,20200032,It's a slick look at the former first lady; out of the White House and carving out her life post-politics; but it's as polished and smoothed out as a campaign ad. It's a warm latte; delivered to you in your favorite mug.
3981,20200032,The sad; unintended moral of Becoming is that if this country never sees a President Michelle Obama; it is our own fault.
3982,20200032,With Obama herself as narrator; it's a personal diary -- bereft of tension and short on surprises with a perpetually sunny guide treating you to an intimate but selective tour of her life so far.
3983,20200032,Scrape away the gush and the swaggy fashion; and a fascinating portrait emerged of a rather unhappy and discontented high achiever.
3984,20200032,Michelle told her story with charm; grit; adventurism and several appalling book-tour choices of dress.
3985,20200033,In 'Premature'; Green weaves the city; the summer atmosphere; and the urgency of young love into a story that will remind you of your first love.
3986,20200033,A warm; tender and refreshingly un-Hollywood love story. Zora Howard gives a breakthrough performance
3987,20200033,The visual beauty of Green and Valladao's craft; best demonstrated by a knack for finding soft splashes of color to warm up gelid moments or facilitate passion; positions Premature as a mournful ode to contemporary Black identity.
3988,20200033,Sure there are plenty of films about self-discovery and teenage love; but Premature is different- it's a thoughtful work that cuts right to the heart.
3989,20200033,Premature is an extremely vulnerable portrait of a Black teen girl in love... It's also a necessary reality check for those who may have forgotten what real teen love looks like.
3990,20200033,Premature is the kind of confident; remarkably vulnerable drama to which even veteran storytellers aspire.
3991,20200033,Green takes a slight story and packs it with attitude and feeling. Every moment rings true; the vividly textured locations and knockabout relationships more visited than created.
3992,20200033,"""Premature"" doesn't break much new ground. But it sure breaks hearts."
3993,20200033,"""Premature"" offers a ground-level alternative to more sensationalistic; adversity-themed African-American stories."
3994,20200033,To watch Ayanna quietly think her way through each situation - whether she's taking pleasure in a new experience or weighing the consequences of a difficult decision - is to watch a person coming into being; not a moment too soon or late.
3995,20200033,Rashaad Ernesto Green's poignant coming-of-age drama reflects his fruitful collaboration with Zora Howard; who wrote the script with him and also stars as Ayanna; a high-school senior in Harlem who is preparing to leave for college.
3996,20200033,"""Premature"" is a delicious slow-burn of a movie; the kind of coming-of-age tale that looks familiar on the surface only to reveal hidden depths of beauty and meaning."
3997,20200034,It's a well-crafted work which reveals only as much as the camera-aware Swift chooses to reveal.
3998,20200034,Will certainly appeal to Swifties; and will hopefully get those who are skeptical to think about her in a different light.
3999,20200034,I think there this movie has a lot of interesting things to say about fame; interesting things to say about how women are conditioned to be good and be nice and not make waves and get the approval of other people.
4000,20200034,Those who ever doubted Swift's talent; smarts or conviction will find this chronicle eye-opening and extremely entertaining; especially when she's not singing or talking about music.
4001,20200034,Lana Wilson's cleverly controlled yet sincerely self-aware documentary about singer/songwriter Taylor Swift.
4002,20200034,A lively but superficial portrait film of America's pop princess.
4003,20200034,Here is the engine of Swift's narrative: Swift's desire to be liked colliding with people not liking her. It's the ultimate celebrity problem; but the doc is smart about injecting it with social meaning by making the case that it stems from gender.
4004,20200034,Wherever one stands in regard to Swift's politics; that portion of the movie is what distinguishes Miss Americana from a host of other projects designed to pull back the curtain on the lives of the rich and famous.
4005,20200034,What I appreciated about it; and what gave me a healthy respect for [Taylor Swift]; is that she's somebody who was dismissed as lightweight and she's come into her own... You see her growing.
4006,20200034,Sometimes it's hard to watch; but more often it is endearing; giving viewers a better understanding of just how lonely it truly is at the top.
4007,20200034,"""Miss Americana"" offers an effective backstage look at Taylor Swift that works best when the megastar opens up about her life and experiences in surprisingly candid ways."
4008,20200034,I came away with a whole new appreciation for one of the most famous people on the planet.
4009,20200035,In blurring the physical and emotional into a uniquely sensory experience; one in which the head and heart are thrown hopelessly out of alignment; the film is the best of its kind since Call Me By Your Name.
4010,20200035,"Aka ""Call Me By Your Georgian Name."""
4011,20200035,"And Then We Danced' is a superb drama; and a big-hearted exploration of one young man's desire for escape and liberation."""
4012,20200035,An honestly told story about identity; self-discovery and sexual awakening; led by a naturally warm lead performance.
4013,20200035,It's not too early to say that the most heartbreaking performance of the new year comes from Levan Gelbakhiani as Merab.
4014,20200035,Easy to watch and difficult to ignore.
4015,20200035,A powerful; poignant message of courage and self-acceptance.
4016,20200035,The physicality of this picture is exciting.
4017,20200035,Gelbakhiani makes a vulnerable yet resilient protagonist; and it's shot and performed with verve and feeling.
4018,20200035,Levan Akin's And Then We Danced is giddy with the pleasures of first love -- how it pulsates through the body and mind.
4019,20200035,For all the high arthouse trappings; the tone is human.
4020,20200035,Unfortunately; neither dance nor travel ultimately compensates for the melodrama.
4021,20200036,This is anime remixed with romance and rock opera ballads - much more of a confection than a social critique. Weathering With You is a typhoon-infused fantasy grounded in a tangible reality.
4022,20200036,Another essential slice of thumping; bittersweet genius from one of Japan's great modern anime auteurs.
4023,20200036,Weathering With You also explores the myriad effects of climate change on our industrialized society; but I think its message is one of simultaneous resignedness and hope.
4024,20200036,It is hard for anyone in the Japanese animation industry to escape the legend of Miyazaki. But Shinkai is paving his own path and he expands on the success of Your Name with Weathering with You.
4025,20200036,I love this movie.
4026,20200036,Viewing this as a standalone film without all the comparisons; it's hard to deny the wonderfully charming chemistry between Hina and Hodaka.
4027,20200036,I loved Your Name; even as I recognized I was not the ideal target audience for it; and that's why I watched Weathering With You with that ideal target audience: a gaggle of teens.
4028,20200036,A resplendent piece of anime art... Mr. Shinkai has marshaled more themes than he knows how to organize; but his film feels fresh and urgent.
4029,20200036,"Shinkai's sensitive treatment of these real-world problems gives the fantasy of ""Weathering With You"" a thought-provoking edge many more lavish American animated films lack."
4030,20200036,Weathering With You is a perfect entry point for animation fans who are still looking for the next big Pixar or Hayao Miyazaki.
4031,20200036,Shinkai... has created another world to lose yourself in.
4032,20200036,Vividly contemporary-not an archetypal fable; but rather a compelling yarn about young people trying to live and love in an often hostile world of grown-ups
4033,20200037,A remarkably mature and accomplished film from 28-year-old director/co-writer Kantemir Balagov.
4034,20200037,The movie's fluid camerawork; set detail; and deeply saturated greens and shocking reds help mitigate the gloom. And the acting is top-notch; especially considering that most of the players are non-professionals.
4035,20200037,There is no light touch here; but by the time you reach the film's final 20 minutes; it has earned its fever-dream intensity.
4036,20200037,A remarkable study of a people permanently scarred by war as they dig themselves out from the ruins.
4037,20200037,What results is a consistently unsteady; heated-but-hazy emotional air; and a film that's a bit bullish in its running time and scenework - especially considering its structure.
4038,20200037,Image of a texture difficult to be seen in digital productions; which converts the vast majority of shots into almost pictorial works of art. [Full Review in Spanish]
4039,20200037,Will they ever know this kind of brightness and cheer again; or are their clothes and peeling wallpaper expressing emotions that they cannot? Balagov doesn't say; but in spite of it all he leaves you with a shred of hope.
4040,20200037,There are a lot of powerful scenes. It does end up being a little bit monotone... A little lightness would not have destroyed what was going on in this film.
4041,20200037,Even if the film seems slow at times; there's always something to look at; including Miroshnichenko and Perelygina; who are able to find grace and dignity in two such odd; hollowed out characters.
4042,20200037,If you can grit through it; the film offers a rewarding - if also unnerving - look at survival in the face of tragedy.
4043,20200037,They can't look away. Neither may you.
4044,20200037,The story is compounded by Balagov's imposing visual aesthetic; which was evident in Closeness but here is on a whole new level.
4045,20200038,Trust and loyalty are put to test in the barbaric underworld portrayed in this vibrant and hypnotic neo-noir thriller. [Full Review in Spanish]
4046,20200038,The film's tensions stem from the impermanent; impressive ways its resonances flicker; the ways its images are captured; and the way; never less than successful; that it makes familiar scenes seem new.
4047,20200038,Great Wuhan; China-set neo-noir gangster film from auteur Yinan Diao with wuxia superstar Hu Ge in lead role. A Chinese Odd Man Out.
4048,20200038,If you want something that is not formulaic or by the book; then check out this bold; beautiful and brutal film.
4049,20200038,Diao isn't content just to make an engaging story; either; no matter how poignant... What Diao attends to most of all is his shot selection.
4050,20200038,"""Goose Lake"" is a stunningly photographed ride; one that is never remotely dull and often heads into unexpected terrain."
4051,20200038,Diao is a master of both settings and set-pieces. Unfortunately; the characters and plot twists are much less compelling.
4052,20200038,It's an exercise in pure cinema; an abstract painting of a crime story.
4053,20200038,As with most films of this type; the pleasures arrive less in the originality of the story than in the way the way it's told.
4054,20200038,The movie exhilarates.
4055,20200038,Perhaps the world [Yinan] creates is a bit too scattered for its own good; but you will still want to melt inside its stunning; riotous glow.
4056,20200038,What it all adds up to has some of the unevenness of a nightmare; the belly sweat and oscillating fans of muggy summer heat mixed up with unrealities.
4057,20200039,Road trip drama is dour but solid; mild sexuality; language.
4058,20200039,A low-key family themed drama that's bittersweet and sometimes funny.
4059,20200039,There's a lot of new stuff around [the characters]; but a very old wound between them...and a lot of the stuff that is used to mend their relationship is glossed over.
4060,20200039,An enjoyable mix of family drama and road trip movie; elevated by strong performances. [Full Review in Spanish]
4061,20200039,End of Sentence is a wonderful film; where broken relationships can gain new life; where fathers and sons can learn to forgive.
4062,20200039,While unassuming in its presentation; this is the sort of film where the acting and the dynamic do a lot of the heavy lifting.
4063,20200039,A deliberate; gentle; genuinely caring debut feature from Icelandic director Elfar Adalsteins.
4064,20200039,Casually cathartic at times; cathartically casual at others; this affecting little film about fathers and sons knows that some wounds never heal; but it's never too late to stop the bleeding.
4065,20200039,This is a lovely little gem.
4066,20200039,In his feature directing debut; Icelandic filmmaker Elfar Adalsteins demonstrates a steady hand with both his actors and the pacing.
4067,20200039,Hawkes and Lerman are a pleasure to watch as they ease on down this road.
4068,20200039,Like taking a deep breath of spring air after spending too long inside.
4069,20200040,Sorry We Missed You will make you look at the person bringing it to you and see them for who they are.
4070,20200040,Loach's film does the work of putting their theories into practice; showing how policy decisions made in isolation ripple out into tragedy once they're enacted.
4071,20200040,Give Loach this much: He refuses to compromise his vision. And that vision doesn't include the kind of false hope that television sitcoms in particular offer.
4072,20200040,Loach returns with an essential take on the gig economy that's as gorgeously made as it is humane and tender.
4073,20200040,Raw; unflinching and disturbingly authentic.
4074,20200040,"""Sorry"" is a story that could have been told with anger; but Loach instead opts for desperation. This makes for a devastating experience."
4075,20200040,What makes it one of Loach's best isn't just its rage (which is plentiful) but its compassion (which is overwhelming).
4076,20200040,In their domestic gut-punch of a story; they've exposed our new feudalism in a way that feels honest and blisteringly human.
4077,20200040,"A lacerating social drama that proceeds to demolish the current corporate line on ""gig work."""
4078,20200040,Loach; working with a script by Paul Laverty; follows the dramatic principle of Murphy's Law; piling an agonizing litany of undeserved misfortunes on characters left blank.
4079,20200040,This absorbing and ultimately shattering portrayal of the costs of a late-capitalist system obsessed with convenience; efficiency and nanosecond precision couldn't be more timely.
4080,20200040,"""Sorry We Missed You"" depicts the vise into which many people are forced to put head; hearts; and lives in order to pay the rent and feed their families."
4081,20200041,Manages to plant its flag as one of the more solid Lovecraft movies to date by succeeding in the main place the author often fell down: Humanity.
4082,20200041,For all its grotesque visual effects; Stanley is aiming to make Lovecraft relevant; with a movie about an environmental catastrophe that; while not man-made; is dismayingly recognizable.
4083,20200041,Sinister sci-fi terror tale; revolving around a mysteriously glowing meteor fragment that lands in a family's front yard.
4084,20200041,Scifi horror mixed with a director whose vision feels relevant in today's formula based cinema. [Full review in Spanish].
4085,20200041,Not going to be a movie for everyone ... but after years of stepping away from feature filmmaking; you have to at least admire [Richard] Stanley for creating something that's distinctly his own.
4086,20200041,I've never read [the short story]; so can't comment on how valid Stanley's film is as an adaptation; but as a freaky movie about cosmic infection; it's frighteningly effective.
4087,20200041,[Color Out of Space is] the kind of cult movie nirvana that was its apparent destiny from the moment the cameras started rolling.
4088,20200041,Everything's out of control. Which is what makes Color Out of Space such an entertaining ride.
4089,20200041,Cage in particular is very much in his element; proving his reputation as an undisciplined weirdo is less than deserved. His performance is one long freakout; but a carefully calibrated one; escalating as the situation deteriorates.
4090,20200041,It takes a lot for a movie to out-bonkers Cage on this kind of form. Color out of Space manages it in style.
4091,20200041,Love it or loathe it; Stanley is trying to do something distinctively his own after all those years in the cold. His movie perhaps has the makings of a cult classic.
4092,20200041,Stylised weirdness can only take you so far; though.
4093,20200042,Piquant; precise; and charming from top to bottom; Uncorked instantly enters the pantheon of great wine movies...
4094,20200042,Niecy Nash deserves a compliment for combining her comic moments with her character's more serious nature... However; Uncorked is nothing more than a complacent and sentimental film with a uniquel setting. [Full review in Spanish]
4095,20200042,The acting is unforced and the performers appealing.
4096,20200042,Flavoursome enough without being especially nourishing; this will still be enjoyed by many out there looking for some sentimental sweetness in dark times.
4097,20200042,A fresh perspective with a dose of originality.
4098,20200042,The story - someone pursues an unusual profession to the chagrin of their family - is familiar. Luckily; the direction is deft and the acting is great (Courtney B. Vance is; as always; a standout); putting 'Uncorked' slightly higher than its peers.
4099,20200042,[Uncorked] is closer to a satisfying; everyday table wine than a rare; award-winning bottle.
4100,20200042,"""Uncorked"" is a familiar sort of story in a unique setting. The result is well-rounded; a bit too dry; yet it goes down with a pleasant finish."
4101,20200042,This is a very simple and very lightweight [comedy]; but charming in its own way.
4102,20200042,It's sweet; medium-bodied; and unchallenging. It's the kind of movie anyone can easily curl up with; without too much thought. Just don't forget the wine.
4103,20200042,Captures an energy that's far too common in modern culture in regards to what we pursue; why we pursue it; and the way we dream. We all should be paying attention.
4104,20200042,"""Uncorked"" pours an old; old wine into an unexpected new bottle; and while the results are hardly vintage; it still goes down better than two-buck chuck."
4105,20200043,The candidate's gumption is sure to win her the audience's support; her relationships with her two sisters and her liberal dad are nicely sketched; and her achievements in the election are realistic yet designed for maximum poignancy.
4106,20200043,The Perfect Candidate is now available on selected VOD sites and is well worth your consideration while you're self-isolating; or at any time for that matter.
4107,20200043,A gently courageous piece of Arab cinema.
4108,20200043,Perhaps the most admirable thing about Al-Mansour's approach here is that she isn't beyond relying on artifice and melodrama to advance the story.
4109,20200043,A young Saudi doctor runs for local political office; finding her courage while more frustrated than usual by the limitations and restrictions placed upon her. Heartening; inspiring; gently ironic.
4110,20200043,Haifaa Al Mansour deploys sly charm and winning humour as she tackles her country's endemic sexism in this surprisingly feelgood tale.
4111,20200043,Maryam's story is one to empathise with; but still precise enough to entirely belong to her.
4112,20200043,Al Mansour gives her audience a fine lesson in some key ingredients of political life in Saudi or anywhere else: nepotism; cynicism; sexism and chaos.
4113,20200043,For [director Haifaa al-Mansour]; it's ... an opportunity to reflect on the progress made in Saudi Arabia by courageous women just like her.
4114,20200043,[Haifaa al-Mansour] goes where no one's gone before and makes it look easy.
4115,20200043,[I]t's deeply thrilling - possibly one of the most exhilarating moments you'll see in a film all year.
4116,20200043,The most subversive aspect of Haifaa al-Mansour's film may be the kind of change it puts in front of us: inching not sprinting; some way from perfect.
4117,20200044,Shirley is probably too niche to attract the Academy's interest in Moss - how has she never been nominated? - but it's a big; messy; masterfully itchy performance and yet another notch in her belt.
4118,20200044,What I think elevates this film from typical genre; quasi-horror fare is a pretty smart script and really strong acting across the board.
4119,20200044,What's great about this movie is the pace of it and the acting. Particularly that of Elisabeth Moss; who is just wonderful in everything she does.
4120,20200044,This intimate and richly textured peek into the nature of celebrity and the artistic process; which sidesteps convention and avoids cheap sympathy for its troubled protagonist.
4121,20200044,Shirley says she's a witch; and it would come as no surprise; as Decker's latest has you bound by some sort of spell from its very first moments.
4122,20200044,Shirley is a spellbinding piece that sits heavily on your chest; like a malevolent presence. Elisabeth Moss is absolutely incredible in the role and it's impossible to look away from her.
4123,20200044,[The] twisted dynamic is thrilling; all the more so because Moss' performance as Shirley is so ferocious.
4124,20200044,Earns an A for ambition but a grade average lowered by prolixity; pomposity; murky complexity and an excess of perversity.
4125,20200044,Moss's facial expressions have a virtually musical complexity and offer surprises; with fiery glares and subtly tormented distortions that shift very slowly and infinitesimally but register onscreen with great dramatic power.
4126,20200044,With the support of Moss; who's become a specialist in deconstructing the idea of feminine hysteria; and Young; who plays Rose like the flushed heroine of a grim fairy tale; Decker ends up in a place that's strange and satisfying.
4127,20200044,By the time Shirley draws to a close; you end up feeling pleasingly spent; like you just stayed up all night drinking a bottle of Canadian Club while discussing literary theory with a dear old confidant you hadn't seen in years.
4128,20200044,"There are few more daring actors around right now than Moss; and ""Shirley"" may be her best performance yet. She's brutally cutting but the pain of every slight ripples across her face."
4129,20200045,Silverstein gives us a window onto the lives of people passed over in America; who nonetheless manage to find glimmers of joy; even as they fight against those who would bring them down.
4130,20200045,Rob Morgan has always been a gifted character actor; but here Silverstein gives him the opportunity to show how formidable he is at shepherding the narrative.
4131,20200045,As Abe; Rob Morgan carries a weary self-assurance and the bone-deep wisdom of a survivor; and it's heartbreaking; in this story about found family and forgiveness.
4132,20200045,Low-key; naturalistic drama with a lot of familiar beats whose strength is in depicting a child at the crossroads.
4133,20200045,Maudlin; quiet; and natural; 'Bull' captures; with a raw edge; the lives of a marginalized society within a marginalized society; and how human connection can still grow therein.
4134,20200045,In its best moments; Bull's close; direct observation of character and intimate rendition of time and place reminded me of the films of Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne.
4135,20200045,The lumpiness of Bull doesn't negate the tenderness and observation that brings its world to life.
4136,20200045,This movie has a rare sense of place. It preserves an entire world and the fragile people within it.
4137,20200045,It's a stoic work; but its stoicism looks; in the end; like mercy.
4138,20200045,The film aims for a tone of observant; respectful realism; which results in some slack patches but also has the virtue of honesty.
4139,20200045,The patient; observant camera captures the sensitive performances by Havard and Morgan; and they are never less than eloquent and honest.
4140,20200045,The reason you need to see Bull... and we do not use that verb lightly; is Morgan.
4141,20200046,Coogan and Brydon's final road trip has warmth but swearing.
4142,20200046,The Trip To Greece sends the series off on a high note with more fun comedic banter between Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon; even if it is slowly-paced.
4143,20200046,Like the Greek heroes that the two of them are emulating; The Trip to Greece is a bittersweet end to Brydon and Coogan's odyssey.
4144,20200046,It's hard to think of another movie right now that benefits so enormously from the diminished expectations and half-assed attention spans of home viewing.
4145,20200046,There's no doubt the luxurious sojourn is as funny as their previous trips; only this time around there is a tinge of pathos to the comedy...They reprise their deep infatuation with the performance by Anthony Hopkins as Captain Bligh in The Bounty.
4146,20200046,There's just something endlessly endearing and engrossing about watching these two try to outwit; outsmart and just try to make each other laugh.
4147,20200046,At least everyone seems self-aware about how much they're repeating themselves yet again.
4148,20200046,The joy for me; or the steady-state enjoyment that occasionally rises to joy; is the far-ranging; free-associating quality of Rob's and Steve's riffs; and; most deliciously; their wizardly impressions.
4149,20200046,Not much has changed in a decade of tripping.
4150,20200046,Personally; I hope we haven't seen the last of this squabbling; endearing duo - or heard the last of their Michael Caine.
4151,20200046,"Yet the melancholy of the outside world eventually creeps in and crashes the party like an unwelcome dinner guest; bringing ""Greece"" to an oddly unsettling finish."
4152,20200046,What began as a fairly lighthearted series of vignettes has developed some gravitas in the end.
4153,20200047,Writer-director Tayarisha Poe's film is worthy; but like Tales From the Loop; purports to be deeper than it really is.
4154,20200047,Poe's steady hand keeps the balance between realistic teen drama and the crime genre; allowing its examination of melodrama surrounding betrayal; rule-breaking and power-grabs to breathe true.
4155,20200047,The film seems more interested in the brilliance of its image and in the vanity game of its characters than in constructing a complex story. [Full Review in Spanish]
4156,20200047,Somewhere within the bones of Selah and the Spades is a terrific high school movie but sadly; there's a feel of missed opportunity that permeates this frustratingly opaque film.
4157,20200047,Selah is a fully written and expertly directed character; she's a force to be reckoned with. She's strong; beautiful; bold; and driven by power.
4158,20200047,Dead Poets Society meets  All About Eve in this stylishly offbeat addition to the boarding school genre.
4159,20200047,"""Selah and the Spades"" showcases a talented writer and filmmaker furiously struggling to find her feet. When she does; the results may be something to see."
4160,20200047,"The tone here isn't fun or playful or tongue-in-cheek; ""Selah"" takes itself dead seriously; which makes its world even less inviting."
4161,20200047,It's closer to horror than the usual lightweight fare one finds in the genre.
4162,20200047,It's impassioned; informed and sometimes furious work that could find Poe being name-checked herself not too long from now.
4163,20200047,Poe - a new kid on the block who already feels like a major talent - calls a spade a spade but manages to be dreamily oblique; right to the end.
4164,20200047,Poe's feature debut; though; has a style all its own; spare but rich and able to make the umpteenth teen movie we've all seen feel fresh.
4165,20200048,There's a moral complexity to Mirabella-Davis' film that is suggested at rather than explored; which is unfortunate; as deeper down in the weeds there is a lot more to untangle.
4166,20200048,An expectant mother develops a taste for marbles; pins and worse in Swallow; a challenging body horror flick some will find unpalatable; but is worth ingesting.
4167,20200048,Swallow explores the complexities of mental illness; abortion and rape with an empathy and humanity rarely afforded to these subjects in contemporary cinema.
4168,20200048,Deceptively simple and brutally; emotionally painful.
4169,20200048,A valid premise hidden in a movie with too many obstacles to be understood. [Full review in Spanish].
4170,20200048,Mirabella-Davis tells this story without the need for transgression or complications; which makes Swallow begin to feel like a carnival sideshow.
4171,20200048,It takes place in a landscape that's largely internal - but that's territory that can be just as filled with darkness and dread as a forbidding mansion.
4172,20200048,A remarkably rebellious film; filled with a kind of sly; anarchic energy from which one wants to greedily drink as it cracks through; and pours from; its hard; candy-colored shell.
4173,20200048,The timing feels right for this DSM-friendly thriller; provided you have the stomach for it. This is not an easy watch. There is; however; a lot to chew on.
4174,20200048,"""Swallow"" is Bennett's show: she plays delicate; doting and disturbed with a fragility that is hypnotizing."
4175,20200048,In a time when everyone's anxieties are heightened; it's validating to see a film like Carlo Mirabella-Davis's Swallow; which understands that sometimes the scariest things are grounded in reality.
4176,20200048,This is a movie that cries out for attention; in ways both admirable and grating.
4177,20200049,Promising Young Woman dares to challenge conventions - both in culture and its chosen genre - for a delightfully wicked experience that is all held together by a near-best performance from Carey Mulligan.
4178,20200049,Delivers a scathingly bracing; broad critique of toxic masculinity in all its self- and other-destructive forms
4179,20200049,Fennell's directorial debut starts entertainingly... but it quickly morphs into an ill-judged exploitation film that doesn't so much subvert the casual misogyny of the genre as as reinforce its tropes.
4180,20200049,The ending manages to be both so bitter it curdles the whole picture but also cowardly in its crowd-pleasing wish-fulfilment.
4181,20200049,I have never seen a performance of this type ever before and it truly takes someone as uniquely talented as Carey Mulligan to deliver it perfectly.
4182,20200049,Ultimately; Fennell's debut is a noble effort weakened by a short-sighted adherence to old ideas of crime and punishment.
4183,20200049,Promising Young Woman is as confident as its protagonist; a film that's willing to be a little messy and inconsistent.
4184,20200049,Actress-turned-writer-director Emerald Fennell swings for the fences with an unapologetically bold thriller rooted in the conversations about #MeToo; consent and slut-shaming
4185,20200049,Fennell's film is a vibrant; stylistically precise piece of work; but the sentiments it conveys don't feel examined. It's an acceleration off a cliff when what you'd really like to see is some kind of road forward; no matter how rough.
4186,20200049,Promising Young Woman stops short of a truly radical ending; but only just.
4187,20200049,This is the Mulligan show; though; and she proves every bit at home with humour as she is with serious drama.
4188,20200049,When [Emerald] Fennell finally arrives at her inevitable conclusion; you will be caught off-guard by her narrative dexterity as well as just how much badly-behaved white boys can all resemble versions of a young Brett Kavanaugh.
4189,20200050,The film's stylishly conceived and executed; even if the layers of coincidences are too top heavy for the film's own good.
4190,20200050,There is a marvelous arc to the character that keeps you rooting for her [Sarah] all the way through.
4191,20200050,Mixing Ken Loach-style social realism with Mike Hodge's grasp of stylish murder; much in the vein of 2012's equally razor-balanced sniper shocker Tower Block; you'll be cheering for this good woman when she faces the inevitable showdown.
4192,20200050,A tight; unexpected little thriller headlined by a fantastic lead performance.
4193,20200050,A mixture of Ken Loach and pulp fiction female revenge movies not without its flaws. But as a premiere from director Abner Pastoll; it is a most auspicious debut.
4194,20200050,A routine revenge flick packs a bigger message along with the grisly action.
4195,20200050,Sarah Bolger's trembling; hollowed-out performance gives the film a bleak; authentic weight.
4196,20200050,The opportunistic genre-welding holds together thanks to vivid performances.
4197,20200050,[Pastoll] layers gangland grift; domestic drama and female fury into a satisfying lasagna of mounting violence.
4198,20200050,As cranky as much of the movie made me; Pastoll; Blaney; and especially Bolger all contrive to deliver as satisfying a climax and dénouement to this saga as one could hope for.
4199,20200050,It's blood curdling stuff and it's not for the squeamish; but Bolger grounds it and centers it as the story of a struggling mother protecting her loved ones at any cost.
4200,20200050,A Good Woman Is Hard to Find is a slow burn with an ending that's worth the wait.
4201,20200051,The Willoughbys shines above most of the animated genre efforts of recent history and is sure to thrill younger audiences and their older family members alike.
4202,20200051,The Willoughbys is inconsistent tonally and garishly animated; but its message about family is somewhat comforting.
4203,20200051,Director Kris Pearn and co-director Rob Lodermeier have made a film that feels like the love child of Wes Anderson and Charles Addams.
4204,20200051,With all its ups and downs in the plot rhythm; The Willoughbys is an entertaining option to see with your family. [Full Review in Spanish]
4205,20200051,Very much in the style of Roald Dahl; this is a decent kids movie with witty; wall-to-wall sight and sound gags.
4206,20200051,All in all; The Willoughbys is an amusing; dark; colourful; fast-paced outing.
4207,20200051,It's that sort of smart charm that pulls the film forward even when it temporarily falters; keeping up the good cheer until it eventually embraces the kind of feel-good storylines it rejects early on.
4208,20200051,For all its candy-colored silliness; The Willoughbys is a surprisingly sweet story about chosen families.
4209,20200051,There's a lot going on in The Willoughbys; yet if you can get on board with its manic energy and accelerated plotting; the Netflix animated family comedy-adventure has an oddball charm that works surprisingly well.
4210,20200051,"Though it tends to feel disjointed as a whole; ""The Willoughbys"" thrives when it embraces its grim plot and lets mischief reign."
4211,20200051,The Willoughbys; both the movie and the family; sneak up on you in the most welcome of ways.
4212,20200051,Though the film-makers are indebted to Edward Gorey and Lemony Snicket - and pay musical homage to Mark Mothersbaugh's work on The Royal Tenenbaums - they find their own voice; when it counts.
4213,20200052,"Yet for a documentary so laser-focused on the intricacies of this dynamic group of ""Biospherians"" and the counterculture mentality of the '60s that inspired them; there is little examination of space colonization as manifest destiny."
4214,20200052,Matt Wolf creates an alluring space for you to fall into with Spaceship Earth; charting the ups and downs of the biosphere 2 experiment; weaving a compelling tale that excels more in the second half of the film.
4215,20200052,It's the kind of stuff that you just can't make up; and Wolf's film provides an intriguing glimpse into this notable and productive outgrowth of the counterculture
4216,20200052,It's got a lot to say about the state of our planetary ecology and the psychology of creative dreamers; and it's also a superbly well-timed release as a study of life in isolation.
4217,20200052,The film is a tribute to the entrepreneurial spirit; one that flags sometimes but never truly goes out.
4218,20200052,"Featuring new interviews and lots of archival footage; ""Earth"" is an engrossing exploration of an event many have forgotten."
4219,20200052,[A] documentary as inspiring as it is flat-out bizarre.
4220,20200052,An impressive example of basic storytelling techniques refined for maximum impact; each element reinforcing and feeding off every other element; as in the enclosed ecosystem that it depicts.
4221,20200052,It unspools rather slowly... It could have come together better.
4222,20200052,"""Spaceship Earth"" is an interesting look at the origins of one Arizona's most interesting tourist attractions."
4223,20200052,[Wolf's] documentary lacks the personality and drama that Biosphere 2 also lacked; and central questions about basic human functions within the project are unmentioned.
4224,20200052,How a hippie-utopian notion became a reality - and turned into an Icarus-like parable of how big business and activism aren't the best bedfellows.
4225,20200053,A Ben Affleck redemption vehicle that does great at portraying an honest conflict without being too melodramatic. [Full review in Spanish].
4226,20200053,A particularly beefy performance from [Ben] Affleck creates a potent emotional resonance that more than makes up for the rather thin narrative.
4227,20200053,After his well-publicized departure from Batman; The Way Back is a welcome reminder that Ben Affleck is capable of greatness with the right material.
4228,20200053,Affleck deserves special mention for not just for pulling off a credible acting performance but for; given his own well-publicized struggles with alcohol; taking the role of Jack in the first place.
4229,20200053,The Way Back effectively shows how redemption and recovery can be a slow; but in the end; cathartic process. The finale is open-ended and hopeful; but has a true to life feel to it.
4230,20200053,Ben Affleck gives a tour-de-force performance that is wonderfully and heartbreakingly subtle.
4231,20200053,Despite narrative issues; the film is overall affecting and effective with Ben Affleck's powerful performance being a driving force.
4232,20200053,Despite those momentum-stalling and unnecessary detours; the irresistibly cheer-worthy basketball sequences and Affleck's resonant and authentic performance are more than enough to carry the day.
4233,20200053,Surprisingly solid and not at all mawkish or maudlin as it might look from the outset. This is probably the best work of Ben Affleck's career.
4234,20200053,"Affleck is a superstar who carries darkness and sadness in his shoulders and in his eyes - his Batman was particularly joyless - which makes ""The Way Back"" an ideal role for him."
4235,20200053,The force of Ben Affleck's perpetually anguished glower suggests depths that this redemption-through-sports drama doesn't reach.
4236,20200053,It's a solid effort. There are guts here; just not quite enough glory.
4237,20200054,Establishes incendiary drama within a powder-keg setting for a thoroughly engrossing; tense 105 minutes.
4238,20200054,There's strength in seeing a filmmaker use what they've learned from older cinema as well as their current reality.
4239,20200054,The urgency that's pulsating through the film is endemic of that same restless energy that Ly is using to tap into a sense of angry despair that each character on screen seems to recognise.
4240,20200054,"There is an insight; compassion and generosity of spirit here that most films saddled with the ""gritty; urban thriller"" tag never even aspire to. That [Director Ladj] Ly is capable of this maturity and confidence on debut is astonishing."
4241,20200054,Fueled by Pink Noise's fascinating score; [Les Misérables] is an energetic portrayal of the marginalized who are forced to live a life that is controlled by an unearthly entity above them.
4242,20200054,Perhaps more than ever before; it's time to heed the author's words of wisdom.
4243,20200054,"With ""Les Misérables;"" Ly delivers a passionate protest on behalf of an entire generation; whose future has largely been foreclosed."
4244,20200054,You might call these the slums; but the film is not slumming. The drone itself is a player in this work; and an overhead shot of a ragtag outdoor bazaar reveals the place's startling geometry.
4245,20200054,[Ladj Ly's] film is best when it immerses us in small moments and naturalistic performances; propelled by Pink Noise's electronic score.
4246,20200054,It's an urgent portrait that captures a much different Paris than the original 1862 novel; but its themes remain. Victor Hugo would be proud.
4247,20200054,"When it reaches its boiling point; ""Les Misérables"" absolutely roils."
4248,20200054,"Its merely plot-driven depictions of its residents converges with Ly's merely functional direction; to flatten ""Les Misérables"" into the undistinguished style of conventionally apolitical and socially indifferent conventional crime dramas."
4249,20200055,Though the narrative loses its momentum towards the end of the film; with a talented and diverse cast; Zola still ingratiates us with the performances that we need to feel fulfilled by the end.
4250,20200055,[Zola] is an astute social satire; a hilarious crime caper; and a terrifying cautionary tale.
4251,20200055,The journey is not all that unique; but the way Bravo styles it up and lets the women carry the charge is worthy of more than just a Twitter swipe.
4252,20200055,Zola is entertaining as hell and the cast is brilliant; but I never quite figured out the logic of its internet motif. Still; it's hard not to admire it for the artistic risks it takes.
4253,20200055,Zola; while fun; fails at interrogating why we consume these stories as entertainment without examining the gray areas that these events tend to live in.
4254,20200055,Notes both sour and sweet keep the film emotionally charged through the lurid events; while Mica Levi's synth score accentuates the story's bittersweet tone.
4255,20200055,Zola wouldn't work without such a great ensemble; much like the internet phenomenon it stems from; the magic is in the delivery.
4256,20200055,"But as funny and ferocious as much of ""Zola"" is; it's let down by an increasingly haphazard script that doesn't know how to either sustain its humor or negotiate its turn into darker territory - and so; disappointingly; it waffles."
4257,20200055,Social-media feeds can embolden subjective observations that don't tell the whole truth; but that's exactly what makes this particular example such a perfect fit for its adventurous director.
4258,20200055,For all the movie's digital pings and palm-tree lunacy; there's real humor and humanity threaded through the script; and a point of view that feels far outside that kind of nihilist boys club.
4259,20200055,Turns out Twitter might really have been the ideal platform for this anecdote.
4260,20200055,Bravo grounds her story in a vision of Florida that feels genuinely dangerous and strange in ways that only Florida can; and pulls great performances from her cast; who are all-in on this crazy vision.
4261,20200056,There was just something so deliciously compelling about these teens and their self-contained drama.
4262,20200056,Not as sweet as its title suggests; this subversive contemporary coming-of-age comedy resonates with enough character-driven authenticity to overcome its far-fetched contrivances.
4263,20200056,More teen comedies should push themselves as far as this one does to explore all of the complicated nooks and crannies of adolescence.
4264,20200056,All it takes is the film's obligatory blow-up scene to confirm any suspicion that April and Clara's friendship is made of hay.
4265,20200056,Banana Split brings in classic ingredients of teen comedy and amplifies it with charismatic performances; all showered with a genuine sense of humor.
4266,20200056,What truly zings about Banana Split; though; is that it's a Gen Z romcom actually written by a teenager; with all those accompanying imperfections. That and its ending totally hits the sweet spot.
4267,20200056,Regardless of how far audience members are from their own post-high school; pre-college summer like these teens; there's still truth and plenty of laughter here that feels specific to their experience yet universal to anyone who's had a BFF.
4268,20200056,An entertaining and often insightful look at female friendship during a particularly strange time.
4269,20200056,It is absolutely lovely. If I was going to watch a movie virtually this weekend; I would absolutely pick this one.
4270,20200056,The problem with Banana Split isn't the surface phoniness or lazy comedy but the fact that the movie doesn't offer any insight into its ostensible subjects-among them break-ups; female friendship; and teenage jealousy.
4271,20200056,The fundamental premise of this never really looks anything other than muddled and implausible; and certainly doesn't free up the relationship between Marks and Liberato in any satisfyingly comic direction.
4272,20200056,Banana Split is like a really poor episode of Riverdale; but less compelling.
4273,20200057,Some movies you just can't prepare for. This is one of those. It's a wild and original ride. [Full review in Spanish].
4274,20200057,...an awkward and sometimes silly black-comedy-cum-horror-pic that still manages to feel surprisingly unsavoury much of the time.
4275,20200057,Timpson's clearly into weird cinema; and with Come to Daddy; he's effectively made exactly the kind of film he likes to program at his own festival ... [he also] has a lot of surprises up his sleeve; one of them is very; very clever.
4276,20200057,... a film well worth seeing; for freaks; the freak adjacent and for fans of films unafraid to take some risks and blow the bloody doors off.
4277,20200057,Come to Daddy is wild and wily genre work that slow-builds to a frenzy of violence and weirdness.
4278,20200057,As Come to Daddy morphs into a Scorsese-styled murderous landscape; the standouts are Martin Donovan; whose Brian is full of all sorts of shocking surprises; and Mexico's Ona Grauer...
4279,20200057,Unfortunately; the movie is far more effective in its first half than its second; which degenerates into cheap shocks; absurd plot contrivances and vulgarism for its own sake.
4280,20200057,A film that's as clever as it is strange.
4281,20200057,For anyone who can suppress the urge to gag; Come To Daddy's enthusiasm can be catching.
4282,20200057,Providing both a tight script and interesting directing; and blending the best of indie horror with B-movie violence and gore; it's exactly what it needs to be for both the audience and Norval.
4283,20200057,Any film that opens quoting William Shakespeare and Beyoncé is meant to be regarded with skepticism and giggles; but this dog gets sillier by the minute.
4284,20200057,Incredibly violent and very fun and very strange.
4285,20200058,The second one is still my favorite in the franchise; but this one is good fun.
4286,20200058,Especially for a franchise; being spread this far...this is such a good version; exactly what you're supposed to do; while acknowledging the time passing and taking it in a different direction.
4287,20200058,I'm very impressed.
4288,20200058,Without the signature 'Bayhem' action; it mostly feels like another action film. Not a bad one; but not really anything special apart from connection to a franchise old enough to be a nostalgia-reference to itself.
4289,20200058,It's like walking into Burger King with a craving for a whopper; but they tell you they only have steak tartare. But right now; you want a greasy; fatty whopper. And even if you did want steak tartare; you don't want it made by Burger King.
4290,20200058,"Despite some of the shortcomings; ""Bad Boys for Life"" remains a better-than-expected sequel that manages to redeem itself over the bloated and soulless; though technically better ""Bad Boys II"" (2003)."
4291,20200058,Did anybody ask for this? No; but perhaps we should have.
4292,20200058,[A] triumph.
4293,20200058,I would pound Red Bull and watch it with you again.
4294,20200058,"""Bad Boys for Life"" is a mostly expendable entry into the ""Bad Boys"" franchise; the Will Smith and Martin Lawrence buddy cop series..."
4295,20200058,The plot is daft - Mexicans are out for Mike's blood - but it's knowingly daft and even minor characters manage to shine. Not bad. Not bad at all.
4296,20200058,The Bad Boys may not have quite reformed; but they've grown softer.
4297,20200059,For all of its anthropological power; Zombi Child presents an absorbing kaleidoscopic landscape of imagery that beguiles and confounds; at times we don't know where we are; or even if we're awake or dreaming.
4298,20200059,[Filmmaker Bertrand Bonello's] film seems reasonably sincere; but dreadfully awkward.
4299,20200059,Remains proudly opaque in the way only a French art film can remain.
4300,20200059,"Overall; though; his ""Zombi Child"" is a haunting watch; with long sequences of girls lounging; tortured - so to speak - by boredom ... similar to the girls in Peter Weir's 1975 mystery classic ""Picnic at Hanging Rock."""
4301,20200059,Zombi Child' is not the zombie movie you're expecting. It's a wafting; interior movie; more 'I Walked with a Zombie' than 'Night of the Living Dead;' more whisper than scream.
4302,20200059,Bonello's continent- and time-period-spanning film leads to a surprisingly emotional conclusion; and includes some beautifully haunting imagery.
4303,20200059,For Bonello; whose previous films have emphasized emotional continuity over conventions of chronology and realism; it all seems to be part of the same continuum; suggesting a deeper; contradictory myth.
4304,20200059,"The movie's inconclusiveness is the source of its appeal; ""Zombi Child"" is fueled by insinuation and fascination."
4305,20200059,Haiti's rich history of revolution and rebirth is still in want of filmmakers willing to take it seriously. But at least this one returns the undead to their roots; before they themselves were colonized.
4306,20200059,"French voodoo/gothic drama ""Zombi Child"" is mostly satisfying; but also a little frustrating because of its creators' walking-on-shells sensitivity."
4307,20200059,Bertrand Bonello blends his singular style with his fascination with voodoo for an exceptional film.
4308,20200059,"""Zombi Child"" seeks to interrogate the bitter legacy of French colonialism; from its brutal applications in the past to its spiritual and psychological reverberations in the present."
4309,20200060,There's a real beguiling; naturalistic performance; even when the central character is insufferable in so many ways...
4310,20200060,At 76; Catherine Deneuve can still blow all-comers off a cinema screen; and she does exactly that in Hirokazu Kore-eda's Truth; which playfully explores the vexed relationship between a French film star and her daughter.
4311,20200060,Kore-eda manages to have fun with his super characters while also telling a tale of memory and redemption.
4312,20200060,Deneuve is mesmerising; but I was also sometimes irritated; particularly by the wistful piano music that would never shut up. It is worth seeing but not; perhaps; as much as Kore-eda's other films; which you would do well to search out online.
4313,20200060,If you're looking for a unhurried comedy-drama to watch on an early Friday afternoon with some truly exceptional acting; then The Truth certainly fits the bill
4314,20200060,A Chekovian drama filled to the brim with regrets and recriminations; The Trial certainly provides plenty of opportunities to showcase the skills of its two leading ladies.
4315,20200060,The Truth; like so much of Kore-eda's work; is fundamentally minor; it has one of those slightly maudlin piano scores that he favors; much too blatantly announcing the wistfulness.
4316,20200060,It feels like a chamber piece because it is: a chance for the director to observe an ocean-going star in all her glory; to see what he can do as her captain.
4317,20200060,There's much to relish here.
4318,20200060,This movie is an absorbing serio-comic flourish.
4319,20200060,[Catherine] Deneuve brings plenty of Gallic charm and wit to the table; though the film's concerns are still strictly [Hirokazu] Kore-eda's.
4320,20200060,Catherine Deneuve is so good it hurts in this dramedy from Japanese auteur Hirokazu Kore-eda.
4321,20200061,The real-life parallels certainly lends Sea Fever an extra level of chilling intrigue.
4322,20200061,Sea Fever reverberates with a timely unease.
4323,20200061,[T]he combination of its effective genre storytelling with current real-life events makes for a surprisingly enjoyable experience; especially if you're looking for a little substance underneath the surface.
4324,20200061,To call it another 'Alien' monster movie knockoff is an easy descriptor; but Neasa Hardiman's soulful and quiet direction also evoke the adult tone of 'Alien;' as well as add a unique; wet; chilly sense of place.
4325,20200061,Hardiman; who has worked prolifically in television fiction and non-fiction; creates a claustrophobic atmosphere as the murky; ill-appointed boat slowly becomes a death trap - there's more than a hint of Alien's rusting space tug about it.
4326,20200061,A tense allegory about profiting off the natural world; Sea Fever will likely be remembered as a patient thriller with a thought-provoking script and brilliant practical effects.
4327,20200061,The gory shocks are modest but adequate and the crew's tensions are well dramatised.
4328,20200061,Iffy accents aside; there is an old-school charm to this. Just don't expect any great innovations.
4329,20200061,It's refreshing to have a film that takes itself so seriously by refusing to sacrifice its moral stance in order to satiate the anxieties of viewers-anxieties that have become more prescient than anyone could have imagined.
4330,20200061,It's made well; made intelligently; and it uses a very small budget with confidence...I was really surprised by how much I liked it.
4331,20200061,Sea Fever is a solid bit of seafaring horror aided by strong performances and a queasy atmosphere that'll have you feeling seasick in no time.
4332,20200061,he issue here is that everything from the characterization to the film's visual sensibility feels derivative of these references without inviting much new conversation
4333,20200062,"Dark ""Deerskin"" a devilish delight."
4334,20200062,This horror comedy is bizarre to be sure; featuring Jean Dujardin's best deadpan performance. There's also an intriguing; even suspenseful; shift between him and Adèle Haenel's character as to who is actually in control.
4335,20200062,A closed bank account; an epiphany; a wearable trophy of a suit of armor and off to the races.
4336,20200062,"If there's a weakness in ""Deerskin;"" it's an underwhelming final payoff - but; considering how Dupieux's fascinating set-up paints the movie into a corner; perhaps no ending would have worked."
4337,20200062,"Brisk - just 77 minutes - and delightfully peculiar; ""Deerskin"" is a must-see for anyone who adores absurdist cinema."
4338,20200062,Deerskin works on two levels: as a hilarious and creepy pitch-black comedy; and also as a film rich in allegorical meaning.
4339,20200062,"For a long while; ""Deerskin"" idles affably in first gear; but its guilelessness is a ruse."
4340,20200062,"Brisk; brief; and blissfully strange; ""Deerskin"" could only have come from the possibly alien brain of France's Quentin Dupieux."
4341,20200062,We learn very few specific details about this somewhat monotonous guy; and yet that vagueness makes him and his quest more relatable.
4342,20200062,Quentin Dupieux's glum absurdist fable gives absurdism a bad name. It's a facile notion inflated to feature proportions.
4343,20200062,Georges' descent into madness is never as immediately compelling as it is theoretically clever.
4344,20200062,"Despite playing an odd; mad villain; Dujardin (best known for his Oscar-winning performance in ""The Artist"") remains dangerously charming."
4345,20200063,A little too try-hard Wes-Anderson-whimsical in its visual style; Sometimes; Always; Never succeeds as a sweet and emotionally resonant tale about grief; loss; and remembering those who are still there.
4346,20200063,Nighy is always excellent; securing emotion as the production teeters on the edge of cutesiness.
4347,20200063,In Scrabble-speak; one could say that Bill Nighy lands a double word score in Sometimes Always Never. The film itself; however; doesn't net as many points.
4348,20200063,Sometimes Always Never may take its title from the rules a man must follow when buttoning up a suit jacket; but the rules of grief are not so clear.
4349,20200063,This is a family in deep distress and the actors interpret the story realistically; there is no faux sentimentality; just characters driven by desperate needs for outcomes that may never happen.
4350,20200063,Sometimes Always Never moves at a glacial pace towards a predictable father-and-son reckoning.
4351,20200063,A cherishable; rarefied mystery-comedy.
4352,20200063,Some of the animated interludes inch towards indie tweeness; but the film's tone is too singular to be swamped in formulaic whimsy. Despite spots of dead air - even because of them - it somehow sticks with you.
4353,20200063,The sweet emotional payoff is an unexpected reward.
4354,20200063,An off-beat comedy written by Frank Cottrell Boyce in which Bill Nighy plays a controlling; mordantly witty Scouser coming to terms with the unwritten rules of life.
4355,20200063,Often; the whole shebang plays like a rattle bag of tropes; digressions and stray running gags. Then again; that randomness is perfectly apt...
4356,20200063,"It's no real murder-mystery; but it does pose questions that transcend who did what to whom and when. One of which being whether or not you can really play ""jazz"" in Scrabble."
4357,20200064,It has such a playful attitude toward genre...absurd but quite genuine.
4358,20200064,Amid all the geeky film references and breezy heist-going-wrong shenanigans; this gives The Whistlers real substance.
4359,20200064,"""The Whistlers"" is a hugely entertaining gem -- a witty; stylish caper with a breathtaking finale."
4360,20200064,Porumboiu's direction is absolutely top class; with his juggling of time and space assured and often quite alluring
4361,20200064,Smart; well structured; and slick; The Whistlers is the film you should make someone watch who has said Romanian cinema isn't for them.
4362,20200064,Film noir is not a genre one readily associates with Romanian Cinema... But this playfully slippery thriller doesn't only boast such familiar elements as a world-weary detective; a gorgeous femme fatale and a twisty plot; it's also cracking fun.
4363,20200064,There was a surplus of plot twists; double crosses... It left me cold.
4364,20200064,What it lacks in terms of the rigor associated with Porumboiu's back catalog; it makes up for as a deadpan genre piece with a sly jab. It's a serious work of pulp friction.
4365,20200064,"""The Whistlers"" has more than enough sex and violence to satisfy the average action movie fan. But dig a bit deeper; and you'll find a mother lode of meaning just below the surface."
4366,20200064,The effort's worth it; if only for the pleasure of seeing one of the world's finest filmmakers let his hair down and play his justified paranoia for genre thrills.
4367,20200064,Porumboiu's goal is more obvious - having fun; with a candy-brightness that fans of his low-key oeuvre may take a moment to adjust to.
4368,20200064,As deep as a puddle; but great fun in the moment.
4369,20200065,The film is a guns blazing return to form for the director that feels a bit more grounded than Snatch or Lock; Stock; but still has the larger than life characters we've come to expect.
4370,20200065,These are the types of stories that define Ritchie's brand; and I'll always welcome him dipping his toe back into these waters.
4371,20200065,Ritchie manipulates the plot from one surprising twist to the next. [Full review in Spanish]
4372,20200065,The Gentlemen is a clever and thoroughly entertaining movie that sees Guy Ritchie returning to the past to recover the novelty that made him famous in the first place. [Full Review in Spanish]
4373,20200065,Ritchie's return to his comfort zone has setbacks. But none that make this an unpleasant experience. [Full review in Spanish].
4374,20200065,"Guy Ritchie's latest attempt at going back to his ""criminal"" cinema feels out of place and out of shape; translating into a story with little novelty or none at all; in spite of its top performers best efforts."
4375,20200065,"""The Gentlemen"" never ceases to surprise and amuse."
4376,20200065,There's a very self-aware element to [Matthew McConaughey's] performance and to this film -- for the better. This is a great return to form for Guy Ritchie.
4377,20200065,"This crass; witless; and unpleasant attempt at comedy showcases Ritchie's lack of sense and taste. As two characters agree after looking at the bestiality video; ""You can't unsee it."" But one does not have to look at it in the first place."
4378,20200065,It's not that Ritchie's film doesn't have some zip... But the movie time and time again exalts the gallantry of its gentlemen heroes at the expense of those unlike them. It gives this glass of Gritchie's English Lore a bitter taste.
4379,20200065,Telegraphing dialogue; Tarantino-speak tributes; and a third act plot logjam are tantamount to bringing ants to the picnic; but there's enough repellent on board so as not to bother or distract too much.
4380,20200065,For all its energy and vulgarity; The Gentlemen is a slog; a tedious and unnecessarily unpleasant tour of ground that Ritchie's already covered.
4381,20200066,While the film itself plays with familiar aspects in coming-of-age movies; stand-out performances from Pete Davidson and Jon Cryer and the complex relationships between characters makes the movie an emotional but fun ride.
4382,20200066,Unfairly; Big Time Adolescence suffers from the standard formula of routine coming-of-age comedies that follow the predictable pattern of snarky amusement and surfacing angst.
4383,20200066,The script may let him down more than a few times; but Davidson proves that he's talented enough to carry his own movie.
4384,20200066,The trajectory of Orley's story is far from surprising; but he and his cast handle it with enough cheekiness to make the movie a pleasant; if weightless; diversion.
4385,20200066,The film is certainly predictable yet it demonstrates a unique charm; mainly due to the brotherly chemistry of the two protagonists; who deliver a naturalistic dialogue and genuinely funny situational moments throughout.
4386,20200066,...Accurately recalls a very certain kind of male friend you had in the 9th grade: The ultra-cool older guy who introduced you to vices like cigarettes and pornography. It also understands that guy was destined to burn out pretty quickly.
4387,20200066,Big Time Adolescence is a debauched but heartfelt coming-of-age story about impressionable teenage boys and the imperfect male role models who influence them.
4388,20200066,"""Big Time Adolescence"" doesn't have enough heart or humor to save it from becoming just another movie about white dudes bro-ing out."
4389,20200066,Mostly; the movie is memorable because of Davidson; who with his impish smirk; buggy eyes and short-sighted YOLO philosophy brings a rakish charm to the role of the sketchy high school friend so many people - if they're lucky - eventually outgrow.
4390,20200066,One of those small delights that's designed mostly to make you laugh; though it ends in a place of inevitable wistfulness.
4391,20200066,There's not much to Nancy Meyers assistant turned writer-director Jason Orley's first-time feature but there's just about enough to prove diverting as well as promising for the future...
4392,20200066,It's a coming-of-age movie that relies on the cracked charm of its in-house boorish role model...and the usual storytelling beats.
4393,20200067,There's a sharper film lurking somewhere insider... But those wanting a more detailed exploration of organized crime in Italy - and the mental trauma it inflicted on soldiers and civilians alike - would do well to make time for Bellocchio's latest.
4394,20200067,A legitimately Italian Mafia movie with memoirs; might; mayhem and a running time at least an hour shorter than 'The Irishman.'
4395,20200067,Both The Irishman and The Traitor explore how hollow the back half of a criminal life can be.
4396,20200067,A biopic that probably represents the best true story of the Italian mafia on the big screen.
4397,20200067,"Resists the call of ""Godfather"" films' commercialism by providing a truer picture of how the Italian mafia really conducts business."
4398,20200067,Italian mob biopic is courtroom drama with bloody violence.
4399,20200067,"The biggest betrayal of ""The Traitor"" is its crime against the usually compelling mafia movie genre. This is an offer you can refuse."
4400,20200067,[D]irector Marco Bellocchio enriches the on-screen bloodshed with richly detailed performances and an unpredictable energy that lifts the period crime drama above a mere gangster flick.
4401,20200067,The Traitor is an exploration of betrayal; according to Bellocchio. He seems to be asking; can a man truly change the course of his life; or is it just a pretense? Unfortunately; this account of Buscetta's story doesn't really give us any answers.
4402,20200067,A sturdy if somewhat uninspiring Mafia biopic.
4403,20200067,Show me a classic cosa nostra saga that doesn't affirm the importance of family and... well; I'll show you Marco Bellocchio's The Traitor; everything one hoped The Irishman would be but wasn't.
4404,20200067,"""The Traitor"" doesn't try to make a hero out of Buscetta and it doesn't romanticize the Mafia. It observes the awfulness and ongoing futility of a criminal culture."
4405,20200068,This dramedy is at its best when it puts its central; mismatched pair in the same place and allows Schwartz' and Crystal's shared chemistry to percolate.
4406,20200068,When all is said and done; Standing Up; Falling Down is a heartwarming film about getting a second chance in life.
4407,20200068,Standing Up; Falling Down' falters by presenting too many awkward scenes that don't seem real. But Billy Crystal fans should enjoy his splendid performance as an alcoholic estranged from his angry son.
4408,20200068,In Standing Up; Falling Down; this new style of comedy is light on laughs; but big on heart; weaving together a story of hope; redemption; and second chances with a solid cast led by Ben Schwartz and Billy Crystal.
4409,20200068,Chemistry between the leads is key. Schwartz comfortably holds his own against the evergreen Crystal; twinkle still firmly in his eye.
4410,20200068,The film has a melancholy tone; mixing humour with day-to-day disappointment. This makes it feel refreshingly un-pushy; finding moments that are funny and dramatic without straining for anything momentous.
4411,20200068,The dialogue is so snappy. They have such terrific chemistry together that you want to spend time with them.
4412,20200068,As a dermatologist mentoring a young comedian; Billy Crystal feels real; even in the cheesiest moments.
4413,20200068,The entire enterprise is so muffled and dull you can't believe what you're watching.
4414,20200068,The schmaltz is gone; as is the self-love; and instead we have a sweetly empathetic turn...
4415,20200068,What keeps you hanging on is the Teflon likeability of the leads; welcome vital signs in a film of otherwise aggressive modesty.
4416,20200068,Peter Hoare's script contains bromantic clichés; it's true. But just as many scenes confound.
4417,20200069,Even with these sour notes; the movie is rousing and generous in spirit; and its point is taken: The joke behind the Punch and Judy tradition is no joke.
4418,20200069,Mainly; though; Judy & Punch is an appealingly original work that makes us feel like we're gathering around the fire to hear an engrossing yarn.
4419,20200069,A fresh and fairly funny take on the iconic characters; with strong performances from Wasikowska and Herriman.
4420,20200069,Writer-director Mirrah Foulkes' feminist fairy tale is most unusual. Just as episodic; heightened; melodramatic and violent as the actual shows.
4421,20200069,Its well-flowed tempo and constant barrage of gut-wrenching humor; sickening abuse; and medieval ignorance is sometimes compromised by an awkward rudder...but is otherwise great fun.
4422,20200069,Judy & Punch  is indeed punchy; with themes that have hard-hitting relevancy as writer-director; Mirrah Foulkes; reimagines an old; misogynistic tale into what she calls; 'a feminine inversion of the traditional hero's journey.'
4423,20200069,Judy and Punch would be a revenge story if it was a lesser film uninterested in the dynamics of power and gender. Rather; it's a nuanced and effective exploration of the social structures that oppress certain people - ahem; like women.
4424,20200069,"There was an interesting idea at the heart of ""Judy & Punch;"" but the execution is disappointing."
4425,20200069,What's left is a baroque pantomime; a heavy-handed satire of intolerance whose fun fades faster than the livid bruises on Judy's face.
4426,20200069,Sometimes a movie is so blithely misconceived that all you can do is smile; then wonder how it got made. And be pleased it got made. Where's the harm? Talented people put it together and it looks like they had fun in the process.
4427,20200069,As the movie's tone teeters awkwardly between farce and tragedy; tenderness and bloody vengeance; it's the performances that root it...
4428,20200069,There's no puppet master here - just a pair of hands waving in the air; not quite sure what to do once we're paying attention.
4429,20200070,"If you have been personally victimized by Marie Kondo's book disposals; let's giggle about a glorified ""very special episode"" of Antiques Roadshow."
4430,20200070,If an overall structure is lacking; it can be forgiven. Perhaps Young is trying to replicate the random experience of wandering through an old bookstore and finding diversions and delights where one may.
4431,20200070,The overall experience is like wandering through an antiquarian book store; picking up a volume; starting to flip through in a leisurely fashion; and then having your arm jostled; losing your place; and picking up another tome.
4432,20200070,While this hazy; shifting quality lets The Booksellers feel lighter on its feet; it also makes its inquiries seem insufficiently honed.
4433,20200070,An engrossing documentary that lovingly demonstrates the importance of books within our culture and our evolving relationship to them.
4434,20200070,Even if you're not an avid reader; you'll enjoy this engaging documentary that takes a look at the last of a dying breed; the antiquarian bookseller.
4435,20200070,I finished the film and felt compelled to turn off the screen and pick up a book.
4436,20200070,Do not be misled by the comic charm of this film. It's a ghost story; brooded over by the rustling wraiths of bookstores dead and gone.
4437,20200070,Though it opens with a quote from Susan Sontag invoking Jorge Luis Borges's belief... the film is not about the content; but the container - the tactile; redolent artifact essential to book lovers and sought by collectors.
4438,20200070,"""The Booksellers"" shares a few of those stories and a little of that learning. And I have to tell you: It feels really good to be roaming those aisles of bookshelves again; even if it's just through a screen."
4439,20200070,"""The Booksellers"" looks at where the trade has been; the psychology of why it has survived generations and how it can move forward. It's as warm and inviting as a good book."
4440,20200070,For those that can stick it through; they'll find a unique gem of a movie that they might not know they're missing.
4441,20200071,A stylish and visceral film that questions the veracity of the myths and legends that are part of every nation's history. [Full Review in Spanish]
4442,20200071,In trading the American frontier for barren branch graveyards and facts largely for fiction; this stylized folk tale is patched together by the same needles that weave myths.
4443,20200071,The film is violent; absorbing; and a must for any western fan. Beautifully shot by cinematographer Ari Wegner. The cast is first-rate.
4444,20200071,The truth is not something to be cherished in this fictionalized biopic.
4445,20200071,Neither true nor history; this flight of fantasy has too few moments of excitement buried in the taxing rhetoric.
4446,20200071,They make Ned Kelly more punk rock.
4447,20200071,"""True History of the Kelly Gang;"" for its part; strikes just the right balance of scary and crazy; and it subjects both to an impressive measure of discipline."
4448,20200071,Kurzel's film doesn't simply show us the shattered masculinity and class rage that fueled Kelly's infamous late 19th-century crime spree; it shoots that energy outward like sparks from a forge.
4449,20200071,But for all its real visual flair; it's hard not to feel that the film misses something crucial about Kelly in the end - trading machismo for manhood; and sensation for true history.
4450,20200071,This is myth-making; splattered in blood; scored with an electric guitar; and enacted with such brazen bigness that you wouldn't be surprised if the cast assembled for a curtain call at the end.
4451,20200071,There's a texture and a muck that are so tangible that they really put you in the middle of this film. You can taste it and you can smell it.
4452,20200071,Those who enjoy gritty; angry Westerns (especially those set in the Australian bush rather than along the American frontier) will find much here to their taste; none of which is in need of additional seasoning.
4453,20200072,It did not come across as a tender look back at a youthful time; it just came across as naive - not a naive character but a naive film.
4454,20200072,Feldstein brings her usual wit and charm to the role. But the film is far too predictable; and never quite as funny or moving as it should be.
4455,20200072,Beanie Feldstein captures Johanna's insecurity and her determination to rewrite her life; and isn't afraid to take the character to the dark side.
4456,20200072,[Beanie Feldstein]... is exuberant and fantastic in the role. [Full review in Spanish]
4457,20200072,Beanie Feldstein is the reason to see this film; we view her many moods and personas. A fun; wild; crazy ride with a great message about friendship.
4458,20200072,How to Build a Girl charms fully; but doesn't register much deeper than that.
4459,20200072,You don't have to buy the details of this particular story to understand that it's a good thing to have it in the library.
4460,20200072,It's charming and sweet; and even in its more serious moments; the movie never loses its sense of humor.
4461,20200072,"Beanie Feldstein's charming performance forms the solid base of ""How to Build a Girl;"" a coming-of-age comedy that follows familiar beats but has a winning disposition."
4462,20200072,There's some valuable wisdom in there... But these grounded morals are smuggled into a storyline that's so completely divorced from reality that the end result is more confusing than inspiring.
4463,20200072,"The movie doesn't sympathize with anyone; really. Nick Lowe famously sang that you have to be cruel to be kind. ""How to Build"" is mostly just cruel."
4464,20200072,Giedroyc has a real sense for the oversized emotions of adolescence - to the point that she often channels it literally into a sort of kooky magical realism.
4465,20200073,Like similar music docs; Once Were Brothers relies heavily on archival footage; familiar photographs; and outtakes from photography shoots. ... Yet; the beauty of Rohr's documentary is how engagingly he arranges it.
4466,20200073,It has great performance footage; interesting talking heads; and freighted music. It feels sentimental and bittersweet; with Robertson coming across as a thoughtful; respectful; vaguely professorial figure.
4467,20200073,"The group will remain most famous for the great 1978 Martin Scorsese rock-doc; ""The Last Waltz""; while this is nowhere on par with that; it provides a valuable look into the group's origins; dynamics and the making of that great Scorsese film."
4468,20200073,"Even if ""Once Were Brothers"" is tilted toward Robertson's version of events; it; nevertheless; makes compelling viewing."
4469,20200073,"Full of gorgeous archival footage and genuinely soul-stirring music; ""Once Were Brothers"" is involving from start to finish."
4470,20200073,One of the most entertaining cautionary tales in recent memory; a quality that is likely to land it on a host of top film lists (mine included).
4471,20200073,Robertson has a gift for romanticizing his own hero's journey; even if in the end; the film comes off as elaborate self-justification.
4472,20200073,Music fans will appreciate this cinematic ode to the greatness of the Band; if not its lack of fairness.
4473,20200073,"Even at its most painful; the Band's story captures something golden; incendiary and wistfully beautiful - ""so beautiful;"" Robertson reflects; ""that it went up in flames."""
4474,20200073,Robertson is chasing something different here - a fond remembrance of the complicated friendships lost along the way that celebrates the good times through the music they created while they could.
4475,20200073,The better way to come close to an understanding of who The Band was is to re-watch The Last Waltz instead.
4476,20200073,It's a bracing journey filled with wonderful anecdotes and splendid footage; and it is; emphatically; Robbie Robertson telling the story of The Band; from his perspective.
4477,20200074,Tzi Ma's face is etched with sadness; casting a melancholic pall over the film's entire drama. We truly understand a particular immigrant experience and why some particularly strict parents got that way.
4478,20200074,Tigertail leaves a sour aftertaste because it could have been better than what it ends up being. [Full Review in Spanish]
4479,20200074,A sprawling; multigenerational saga spanning several decades across different continents; Tigertail is also only 91 minutes long; so most of the time it feels like a trailer for itself.
4480,20200074,Yang is a talented filmmaker whose writing has always evidenced a deep; sophisticated understanding of the sometimes-contradictory nature of human emotions
4481,20200074,Emmy-winning Master Of None co-creator Alan Yang's debut feature explores a Taiwanese immigrant's experience with modest grace and sensitivity.
4482,20200074,A profound look at the stories of migrants; especially young people who arrive in foreign countries with disproportionate hopes of what will happen and face a reality from which there is no turning back. [Full review in Spanish]
4483,20200074,The film feels like a three-hour epic that's been slashed to 91 minutes; with crucial details reduced to crude bullet points for economy's sake. It isn't intimate; it's small.
4484,20200074,[W]here the film stands out from other dramas of its type is in its poignant exploration of the little-discussed emotional consequences of single-mindedly pursuing the American dream.
4485,20200074,Alan Yang has given us one immigrant's story that feels like his dad's unique; deeply felt experience; but also makes it reverberate like it's his own - and ours.
4486,20200074,Yang's script is thoughtful and precise -- every character gets to be three-dimensional.
4487,20200074,It's a very quiet; moving; and poignant intergenerational family saga with some lovely directorial flourishes.
4488,20200074,More potent is the sense of choices made young becoming faultlines through a life; creaking under us across decades and continents.
4489,20200075,Initially; you may find 'To the Stars' dealing exclusively in well-worn cliches. But you may eventually find it emotionally disarming you; and then knocking you flat.
4490,20200075,To the Stars is a somewhat formulaic Middle America melodrama; enlivened by inspired and well-directed performances that infuse some radiant life into small-town struggles.
4491,20200075,A queer coming of age drama filled with remarkable moments.
4492,20200075,To the Stars wants to remind us that however bad we think things may be now; back then there were times where it felt like there was nobody there to support those who felt differently.
4493,20200075,Although this is director Martha Stephens' fourth feature; it feels absurd that we haven't heard more about her previous films.
4494,20200075,Parts of the plot feel contrived; especially towards the end; but overall this is a warm-hearted film that will appeal to teenagers bored of fast-cut squealing comedies and blockbusters.
4495,20200075,[I]t is a movie that will reward your patience.
4496,20200075,The filmmakers' purpose is clear -- to portray the implacable prejudice of the time. But the tenderness and humor of the two girls' friendship; and the poetry of Maggie's pretensions; can't compete with the grotesque grimness of later developments.
4497,20200075,The director Martha Stephens; working from a script by Shannon Bradley-Colleary; handles this material smoothly; creating a solid; tangible sense of place with landscapes; gusts of wind and a blue sky that feels more confining than sheltering.
4498,20200075,In some hands; that would be intriguing. Here; however; it's just lukewarm.
4499,20200075,To the Stars seems downcast; at first glance; but it serves as a gentle; lovely reminder that one true friendship; even forged amid adversity; can be enough to keep you looking skyward.
4500,20200075,The period trappings - which must have cost a bomb - are lush and smartly deployed without being heavy-handed; and the two young leads are very watchable.
4501,20200076,For VFW; that proclivity grows overwhelming on both the script level and on screen; which leaves it up to Begos' cast to give his viewers something to grip.
4502,20200076,The film's undeniable lowbrow appeal unfortunately doesn't paper over its tiresome Boomers vs. Millennials conflict; or Begos' vaguely reactionary gushing over the former cohort.
4503,20200076,The paradox of VFW is that it is so lovingly crafted; and yet so utterly; gleefully nasty.
4504,20200076,Though not quite as magic as his previous film Bliss; Joe Begos once more proves that he's a force to reckoned with when it comes to mixing horror elements with punk rock aesthetics.
4505,20200076,It's unfortunate that the combination of small spaces and low light makes some of the action sequences hard to follow; and the film could do with losing ten minutes to tighten up the pace overall; but there's still a lot to enjoy.
4506,20200076,Joe Begos has swiftly become one of the most reliable film-makers in horror.
4507,20200076,This is not a film with depth and personality; but more a homage to some of the most-loved and gory action movies ever made...
4508,20200076,Isn't for the faint of heart and while it might be a stretch buying these seniors fighting off hordes of twentysomethings; the cast make it worth checking out.
4509,20200076,"With a plugin play version of genre tropes; it spins a wheel of more celebrated films with the novelty of it throwing up some devil horns and exclaiming: ""Old guys rule!"""
4510,20200076,It's a regular intergenerational summit of a movie; bringing together a young director on the rise; a cast of veteran actors; and a recently relaunched magazine for an '80s exploitation throwback that's outrageous in all the right ways.
4511,20200076,"""VFW"" is riotously scuzzy and warmly partial to its rusty heroes."
4512,20200076,VFW ultimately lacks the cinematic flair to be truly memorable. But the film succeeds on its own terms of being a nostalgic throwback to the days when such B-movies routinely opened on double and triple bills in urban grindhouses.
4513,20200077,The amusing but initially disposable sketch format gathers momentum and a series of mini-threads emerge.
4514,20200077,A skit-filled 'Kentucky Fried Movie'-like takedown of kitsch 1980s media culture develops into a far more prescient and surprisingly moving satire.
4515,20200077,Uneven retro comedy has lots of sex; drug humor.
4516,20200077,What makes this lo-fi; heartfelt whatsit of a movie so endearing is its willingness to embrace the schizophrenic; protean polyculture of modern pleasure ..
4517,20200077,"Cursed words like ""Facebook"" and ""Instagram"" are never uttered in VHYes; for obvious reasons; but the movie reads like Robbins' thesis that for as long as people have been able to self-document; they've done so with relish..."
4518,20200077,VHYES succeeds by using comedy sketches the wrong way
4519,20200077,Though hardly groundbreaking in either its content or its aesthetics; the film is more serious than it initially lets on; and can only benefit from the VHS nostalgia that has; often irrationally; taken root in some quarters.
4520,20200077,[T]he real problem with VHYes may be that its two modes don't work well together.
4521,20200077,This is pretty thin stuff; written with medium-watt inspiration at best and acted by performers variably able to make it seem better than it is.
4522,20200077,VHYes breaks the biggest rule of parody; over and over again: it simply tries way too hard with material that's far too easy.
4523,20200077,This is a movie that is really just a stream of consciousness; experimental; Robot Chicken-style collage.
4524,20200077,"Throughout; ""VHYes"" laces its nostalgia with bitter poison; reminding its audience that even in the carefree couch potato days of 1987; the end-times always loomed."
4525,20200078,a triumph of style that might have been a truly great horror film if it had something beneath its impressive aesthetic dressing; intense mood; and escalating suspense
4526,20200078,The Lodge is a sombre psychological thriller that leaves the viewers feeling as desolate as the landscape.
4527,20200078,One of the most terrifying adult and introspective offerings in recent years. [Full review in Spanish]
4528,20200078,I recognize The Lodge is an odd recommendation when a good chunk of the population is battling cabin fever. But you can approach it as a cautionary tale. A little personal space goes a long way.
4529,20200078,The Lodge's terror exists in the real world; it's happening right now- in the fanatically faithful; the cruelty of gaslighting; and the exploitation of peoples traumas.
4530,20200078,The narrative doesn't end very well... but the conclusion is still dark; Machiavellian and above all; diabolical. [Full review in Spanish]
4531,20200078,"""The Lodge"" is an exceptionally creepy horror film - and a really disturbing one."
4532,20200078,There's an atmosphere of genuine dread but the screenplay makes way too many illogical choices for the movie to work.
4533,20200078,"""The Lodge"" isn't a perfect treat. But for those who like their movies dark and disturbing; it does the trick."
4534,20200078,"If ""The Lodge"" doesn't answer all the questions it poses; that's okay. Its strength lies in its ability to stir a reaction; and that feeling lasts longer than its explanations. It's a trip you won't forget."
4535,20200078,While The Lodge isn't as hearty as the horror films it desperately wants to emulate; the filmmakers have concocted a heavy stew of emotions; left on a low simmer.
4536,20200078,Keough's work is so strong; so effective; that by the time we learn the ultimate fate of Grace; we would have bought into any of the possible options.
4537,20200079,The Banker unfolds the history of American inequality and racist banking practices. Bernard and Matt; both visionaries; seem to be ahead of their time.
4538,20200079,Ultimately just a solid paint by the numbers [film]. [Full review in Spanish]
4539,20200079,Property investment isn't a conventional career path for a civil rights activist; which is one of the reasons why this slick historical drama is so fascinating.
4540,20200079,Much fresher and richer than what you'd think looking at it from the outside.
4541,20200079,Kind of formulaic; and there are some parts that are definitely corny; but it was so good to see a movie about Black businessmen that own their own companies...great seeing these characters shine; see wealth in a different way in this community...
4542,20200079,It was a great story; of people defying odds in an atypical way...
4543,20200079,Apple has delivered a credible; modestly entertaining entry into the world of prestige film -- but one that won't lose much if written off against the balance sheet of consumers' streaming-TV budgets.
4544,20200079,It gets a little weighed down... [But] I admire so much of the early part of the film.
4545,20200079,It's a fascinating story... But it is depicted in the most safe; bland; just meh biopic form.
4546,20200079,A potentially great; if safely made; film... ends up as a solid one instead.
4547,20200079,"Taken on its own; ""The Banker"" is a pleasant watch. And who wouldn't benefit from a little Mackie and Jackson banter right now?"
4548,20200079,[T]he film is overlong; but the story is an eye-opener and the central performances are terrific.
4549,20200080,The music is quite catchy as the group prepares for its final competition; but at the heart of this is the need for friendship and support; especially during times of uncertainty and a little distraction can be important; too.
4550,20200080,At a time when our world is drowning in uncertainty; Military Wives offers hope. It's the very definition of a feel-good movie.
4551,20200080,Military Wives has heartwarming moments of bonding; heartbreaking depictions of loss and more than a couple scenes perfectly calibrated to produce tears.
4552,20200080,Military Wives is more defined by its modesty than its showmanship; lovely and satisfying but without much in the way of complication or embellishment.
4553,20200080,Charming dramedy has strong female leads; positive themes.
4554,20200080,"There is nothing remotely hip about ""Military Wives;"" yet it feels silly to come down hard on a film this good-natured."
4555,20200080,"There's nothing in ""Military Wives"" you haven't seen before; but these are times of comfort food; and this formulaic comedy-drama... so determined to be uplifting that your up may be lifted in spite of itself."
4556,20200080,There is so little surprise here; and so little effort into at least maintaining the façade of invention; that you might as just well sit down and write the narrative beats yourself.
4557,20200080,Though deeply reliant on formula and wrapped in a blanket of bland; this crowdpleaser about a choir of solders wives squeaks past the rough spots thanks to the acting alchemy of Kristin Scott Thomas and Sharon Horgan
4558,20200080,"No surprises await; but the performances by Scott Thomas; Horgan and company and some pleasant harmonizing make ""Military Wives"" palatable Memorial Day weekend viewing."
4559,20200080,Kristin Scott Thomas and Sharon Horgan do their best to elevate Military Wives from a simple tune to a symphony; but the notes just aren't there on the page.
4560,20200080,Military Wives absolutely succeeds in what it sets out to do - which is; admittedly; not a particularly grand ambition; but that doesn't mean it's not a mark worth hitting.
4561,20200081,It's a level of insight and emotion the film should have brought to all of its characters. But The Photograph remains (sorry) underdeveloped.
4562,20200081,The Photograph makes you want to stick around to see what happens next. This is the nature of romantic dramas - they're the fantasy versions of meat-life relationships.
4563,20200081,An ode to love in its purest form. [Full review in Spanish]
4564,20200081,The Photograph is a study of opposites in so much as the movie itself moves at a slow pace while Michael and Mae's relationship goes from zero to sixty in about ten seconds.
4565,20200081,Writer-director Stella Meghie knots up the plot and inserts so many distracting side characters that it's not easy to connect with.
4566,20200081,THE PHOTOGRAPH's dulcet images may prove to be too muted for some; but for those searching for a raw sensitivity and unapologetic sexuality will be heavily rewarded.
4567,20200081,The American black experience has been the definition of pain; however; we do experience joy; fun; and love like every other race. We also experience success; and that is silently the most powerful element of The Photograph.
4568,20200081,Lakeith Stanfield and Issa Rae do wonderful work as people with an instant connection.
4569,20200081,Revel... in the subtle back-and-forth of becoming smitten; the glances; touches; silences. Think of it as a dance movie; a good one.
4570,20200081,What luck; then; that Stella Meghie's film returns to its stronger elements so often.
4571,20200081,Simply put; Michael and Mae don't get enough time to just be; though a sequel could fix that.
4572,20200081,It's a beguiling combination at first; but the surrounding story is too clunky; the revelations too telegraphed.
4573,20200082,Zooey takes to her role as fervently as some diners take to Buffalo chicken wings.
4574,20200082,... mildly amusing; although its stab at socioeconomic satire feels unearned.
4575,20200082,The blame for this exercise in pointlessness can be allotted fairly equally; I think; between [director Tanya] Wexler and screenwriter/cast member Brian Sacca.
4576,20200082,There's not a lot of laugh-out-loud moments; but it's a fun story to watch unfold.
4577,20200082,"Mostly; ""Buffaloed"" taketh away 95 minutes of your life."
4578,20200082,Zoey Deutch is a star; and watching Buffaloed; you get the sense that one day the rest of the world will catch up to her.
4579,20200082,"[I]t's hard to begrudge ""Buffaloed"" too much; this is a fast; fun watch that succeeds largely on the charms of its star and the able hands of its director."
4580,20200082,In 2017; Zoey Deutch managed to carry Flower; a brisk but slight comedy about an exuberant young hustler with Daddy issues. She does it again in Buffaloed; in which she plays pretty much the same character; but confronts a different social evil.
4581,20200082,"Thanks largely to the feisty Deutch; ""Buffaloed"" is a fun time; even if it's about everybody's least-favorite kind of phone call."
4582,20200082,"This low rent She-Wolf of Wall Street is not without its charms - it's hard not to find some room in one's heart for a film that works so hard to restore the word ""jagoff"" to popular usage."
4583,20200082,It's a blue collar movie that isn't going to make anyone want to move here; but I'm fine with that: take us as we are or leave us alone.
4584,20200082,Buffaloed churns with barely-controlled chaos in its best sequences.
4585,20200083,It's at times baffling; but the surreal web Vivarium draws us into via exceptionally strong production design makes it easier to wave off narrative inconsistencies.
4586,20200083,An unusual Irish-Danish-American-Belgian co-production; Finnegan's film keeps you watching; if sometimes irritated; to see what happens...
4587,20200083,Lorcan Finnegan has established himself on the international scene as one of the most interesting fantastical filmmakers today. [Full review in Spanish]
4588,20200083,Writer/director Lorcan Finnegan... has delivered a mostly pretty tasty and effective film that never quite gets to where you hope it might; but never really drops the ball completely either.
4589,20200083,To say this is the ideal isolation horror movie for these confusing times would be a vast understatement.
4590,20200083,VIVARIUM's version of an endurance test causes your mind to slip. For those dealing with cabin fever; you've been warned.
4591,20200083,I was so onboard with this film for a long time. Really interesting setup and really great acting; but it just doesn't go anywhere.
4592,20200083,Vivarium imagines the horror of being trapped inside your own home. What a concept!
4593,20200083,Vivarium is an ingenious; relentless sci-fi horror from Irish director Lorcan Finnegan and writer Garret Shanley.
4594,20200083,Poots and Eisenberg; effortlessly empathetic and convincing; have done sterling work here.
4595,20200083,Domesticity sucks the life out of everyone. But it's thin thematic reward for seeing the wheels behind this performer's eyes grind to a halt.
4596,20200083,The story comes to a flawless punchline at almost exactly 27 minutes. The snag is that Vivarium has more than an hour still to run...
4597,20200084,The conclusion wraps up a bit too quickly and easily to feel earned; but any happily-ever-after is less important than the path of discovery in finding the way there. That path; and this world and its characters; continues to be a great one.
4598,20200084,If there is any reason to take time to watch this film series; it's to watch Condor and Centineo bring a huge smile to your face.
4599,20200084,The earnest movie can feel a little generically too sweet at times.
4600,20200084,To All The Boys: P.S. I Still Love You continues the love story of Lara Jean and Peter with a believable love triangle and an increasingly mature tone
4601,20200084,Not quite as sharp or successful as the first; but it's still enjoyable and has plenty to admire.
4602,20200084,If I were 16; I would be obsessed with this movie.
4603,20200084,Though it's once again welcome to see a rom-com dig into the specificity of the Korean-American experience... for the most part P.S. I Still Love You is a pleasant distraction without a lot of payoff.
4604,20200084,P.S. I ... don't know if I'm still into this?
4605,20200084,It actually ends up unintentionally undercutting the relationship the film asks us to be invested in.
4606,20200084,[A] reflection shinier than real life maybe; but generous and good-hearted to the core.
4607,20200084,A little of Lara Jean's own timidity may have rubbed off on To All the Boys: PS I Still Love You; but the sequel still stands tall among its romcom peers.
4608,20200084,It's really sweet. if you like the first one you will like this one too.
4609,20200085,The world of The High Note is a sun-soaked; music filled Los Angeles; where everyone gets what they want. It's a nice world to disappear into.
4610,20200085,It is no symphony but it is an okay pop tune of a movie.
4611,20200085,More charming than most movies about music fans in and out of love
4612,20200085,A feel good movie with a great cast and good music? That's what you get with The High Note
4613,20200085,Pushing play on this VOD release is like dropping the needle onto the grooves of your favorite feel-good slab of vinyl. Its sweet jams and inspirational message are always on key and sure to set you in the right mood.
4614,20200085,At its worst it still has the natural charm and skills of Davis and Harrison Jr. on which to coast.
4615,20200085,"""The High Note"" is a glossy; enjoyable; not at all believable show business fairy tale starring two show business princesses: Tracee Ellis Ross (daughter of Diana Ross) and Dakota Johnson (daughter of Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson)."
4616,20200085,"It's a bummer. ""The High Note"" has a chance to tell an original story about the inner-workings of the music business. Instead; it's satisfied playing the greatest hits."
4617,20200085,Tracee Ellis Ross and a supremely entertaining story...she powerfully belts out six new songs while playing a beloved pop singer determined to stay cool.
4618,20200085,A movie with so much love of music in its soul. I had the best time watching this.
4619,20200085,This is an enchanting and escapist summer movie... And it has something to say about the male-driven world of pop music.
4620,20200085,The sincere charm of this romantic comedy triumphs over its plodding pace and narrow purview.
4621,20200086,Extraction is worth watching for those who are action junkies; but for the casual viewer; it will probably leave something to be desired.
4622,20200086,It's all very kinetic eye candy; beautifully lensed with an array of saturated colors that capture the teeming population with steamy verve. But exhaustion eventually sets in.
4623,20200086,A bloody; violent; preposterous movie. Chris Hemsworth is convincing even when the story isn't.
4624,20200086,The action is what saves Extraction from being totally written off considering its story and characters are so generic - the screenplay from Joe Russo (Avengers: Endgame) does it no favours.
4625,20200086,There's not much invention here. But the movie knows we've seen enough such films to fill in the blanks ourselves. Extraction is nothing but chassis; but it's sturdy enough to run.
4626,20200086,Extraction is flawed; especially when it comes to its ending feeling like an indecisive tease; but its extended and bloody action sequences are impressive enough to make Extraction a worthwhile action packed escape for any given evening.
4627,20200086,"[F]or pure; overpowering thrills; ""Extraction"" delivers."
4628,20200086,Extraction made me laugh and cry. Right here; right now; it's manna from the gods.
4629,20200086,"""Extraction"" is effective and more than a little exhausting; but in a way; the smaller scale helps."
4630,20200086,It's a shame this real crowd-pleaser won't be playing to crowds; but it still works as a Friday night; pop-the-popcorn; living room entertainment.
4631,20200086,Extraction is bold not only for the way it tells its story but the medium in which it has chosen to tell it.
4632,20200086,That slip of a setup... triggers breathtaking - and outlandish - action sequences; one of which is a dazzling 11-minute; sorta one-take spectacle... There's even an emotional payoff at the film's end.
4633,20200087,The Wretched is an easy watch and for the most part well-paced to keep a focused attention; but ultimately the multiple relationship conflicts within Ben's story are a huge distraction...
4634,20200087,An accessible teen horror flick feeling for the right path but passing up opps to nail the genre.
4635,20200087,The brothers are masters of execution; and they deploy both physical and computer-generated visual effects to a satisfyingly unsettling conclusion.
4636,20200087,A genuinely creepy and sharply written teen horror that deserves to find a wide audience.
4637,20200087,An insanely fun; horror summer movie. Yeah; it's also pretty scary.[Full review in Spanish].
4638,20200087,The film's angsty adolescent subplots never quite click with its midnight-hour nastiness.
4639,20200087,It's a development worthy of M. Night Shyamalan; but they've run out of runway and there's only enough room left to battle the witch.
4640,20200087,"Equally indebted to Alfred Hitchcock; Steven Spielberg and a mishmash of '80s horror films only the directors themselves could comprehensively name-check; ""The Wretched"" is a fresh horror film built out of familiar parts."
4641,20200087,The Wretched doesn't work as either comfort food or gross-out entertainment.
4642,20200087,If this really was some lost relic of the VHS era; it'd pass the blind rental test: There is a witch; and she's as creepy as the box art would surely promise.
4643,20200087,"""The Wretched"" doesn't reinvent the rules; but it has a timeliness to it that's hard to shake."
4644,20200087,A non-frightening muddle.
4645,20200088,The pop-filled soundtrack and colorful animation should hold younger kids' attention for an hour or so. Which is one less hour they'll spend punching your face.
4646,20200088,"""Trolls World Tour"" recognizes America's problematic music past and isn't afraid to expose the truth while delivering heartfelt lessons."
4647,20200088,There are a few lines that will have you howling. I know they did me. You probably won't love the movie but at least those few lines and the positive message make it tolerable.
4648,20200088,One of the nicest things to say about Trolls World Tour is that it moves pretty briskly. It's not particularly impactful; but it should be entertaining enough for young viewers.
4649,20200088,As far as you; the consumer; goes...don't watch this by yourself; you grown person. But really this is for families; the children...I was genuinely laughing at some of this; and they did things that make this slightly better than the first one.
4650,20200088,A nice; straightforward matinee offering for the kids and their families...not bad. Watch this to bring some brightness into your life right now...
4651,20200088,Kids will probably be tickled by the slapstick humor and whimsical dance numbers.
4652,20200088,It seems unlikely that World Tour will change the way we watch movies. But; I s*** you not; it is worth watching.
4653,20200088,Reader; I wept.
4654,20200088,"The plot gives ""World Tour"" an opportunity to cycle through countless hits; and it does so so speedily that the film often feels less like a story than an impatient; candy-colored battle of the bands."
4655,20200088,"""Trolls: World Tour"" is not a mindblowing cinematic achievement; but it is exactly what kids; and parents; need right now. That's where it hits the high note."
4656,20200088,I don't know if a six-year-old -- who the animation appears designed for in terms of style; brightness; and color -- would get any of the jokes; but as a person trapped in my house; I appreciated them.
4657,20200089,At a brisk 97 minutes; [Szumowska] gets at the deep psychological roots of male domination and renders something as alarming as that should be.
4658,20200089,Although its striking visual style is captivating; The Other Lamb ends up getting lost from the flock due to its predictable and puzzling narrative. [Full Review in Spanish]
4659,20200089,It's a genuine spellbinder that's both beautiful and alarming; succeeding as a strong example of visually-dependant storytelling and a bewitching work of art that understands the collective power of femininity.
4660,20200089,Denotes a recent trend in horror: The feminist wilderness parable. And while 'The Other Lamb' may not have the heft of 'The Witch' or 'Hagazussa;' it evokes similar senses of dread and misogynist injustice.
4661,20200089,If you ever thought joining a zombie cult would be fun; think again.
4662,20200089,It's a resonant tale of a young woman who learns to reject the deeply patriarchal system in which she was raised; to carve out a narrative outside of the one she has been forced to believe.
4663,20200089,In reinforcing their themes of religious and cultural oppression; [Szumowska and McMullen] hit the nail too squarely on the head.
4664,20200089,"As a study in atmospheric seclusion; ""The Other Lamb"" is beautifully crafted enough to hold your attention; but you can't shake the feeling that Selah's next chapter - and Cassidy's - might well be the more interesting movie."
4665,20200089,Although The Other Lamb is heavy-handed in every conceivable way and a few ways you'd never have conceived of; it has a special resonance in the spring of 2020.
4666,20200089,It's about as subtle as a brick through a windshield. But in Szumowksa's capable hands; with Cassidy as her anchor; this one leaves a haunting aftertaste.
4667,20200089,Set in some indeterminate time and place rarely betrayed by modern technology or dress; The Other Lamb mostly operates in the realm of allegory.
4668,20200089,The Other Lamb is not a subtle allegory; but it never claims to be. Rather; it's a phoenix rising from the ashes...
4669,20200090,Sonic the Hedgehog takes Sega's standard bearer for the concept of cool and commits the unthinkable. Sonic is boring.
4670,20200090,This is pure fluff; and it's likely destined to be forgotten by year's end. But considering it all; that's very likely all that Sonic the Hedgehog intends to be.
4671,20200090,This is a movie that frequently makes jokes at the expense of Olive Garden; while itself being the Olive Garden of movies.
4672,20200090,May be the rare case in which the angry fans were right. Looks great with no significant visual flaws ... is a sweet little film that is always fun and lively and never takes itself too seriously.
4673,20200090,It was cute and fun.
4674,20200090,It was what I've been asking for; honestly.
4675,20200090,Affectionate; charming; and genial.
4676,20200090,The simple storyline finds a way to adapt the games' characters and themes; by adding universal concepts such as friendship to the original games' tension between nature and machines.
4677,20200090,The world contains many terrible video game movies. This isn't one of them.
4678,20200090,File this one away next to the live-action Alvin and the Chipmunks; the live-action Yogi Bear; and the live-action Rocky and Bullwinkle. It's nothing we haven't seen before.
4679,20200090,Sure; there's enough here to divert small people for a while; but their parents would do well to bring a blindfold and ear plugs.
4680,20200090,If you want [a] light; fun escape; this is it.
4681,20200091,It is a story without a happy ending; or even an ending at all. But Garbus isn't so naive or precious a storyteller to expect reality to afford one - and she should be applauded for not waiting around in vain.
4682,20200091,Garbus brings off something extraordinary in a film that sets out to leave us sad; enraged; and profoundly unsatisfied. Lost Girls makes us want to rethink our need for a certain kind of closure in a world that has so little of it.
4683,20200091,Though the screenplay leaves out a crucial need-to-know detail or two; a flawless display from Ryan keeps you right at Mari's side during a tragic; yet important quest.
4684,20200091,Unfocused on what it wants to be; the film's half-hearted approach to an essential story leaves you disappointed.
4685,20200091,[Amy Ryan] achieves the impossible. [Full review in Spanish]
4686,20200091,Lost Girls greatly overcomes the challenges involved in adapting a real case to a fictional movie. [Full Review in Spanish]
4687,20200091,It feels incomplete; not developed enough for us to fully be immersed in the story; the result is a suspense-free procedural with barely any stakes at hand.
4688,20200091,It's a compelling story. The execution isn't as even or focused as you may wish; but this is clearly a passionate; well-intentioned look at a tragic tale featuring imperfect characters and a strong lead performance by Amy Ryan.
4689,20200091,"You may have already seen the story of the ""Lost Girls"" on true-crime shows; but this film makes the loss of so many young women; whose killer or killers have never been caught; so much more tragic."
4690,20200091,What's both intriguing and frustrating about the screen version; however; is the way that it flirts with a much thornier and potentially richer possibility; only to ultimately back away from that idea in favor of a straightforward plea for justice.
4691,20200091,It's serious; respectful; gravely melancholic. Yet anger best describes the movie's atmosphere; its overall mood and its authorial tone.
4692,20200091,"""Lost Girls"" hits hard."
4693,20200092,The conclusion is meaningfully painful and actually felt like an invitation to revisit the film; a privilege afforded to streaming flicks that is too rarely exploited.
4694,20200092,The film looks like it's shipwrecked. Adrift. [Full review in Spanish]
4695,20200092,An ambitious; odd project; and one that sticks stubbornly in the mind's eye.
4696,20200092,Horse Girl unfolds like a fever dream; appropriately. A twisting narrative built upon strong performances. The end is far from satisfying; but that's part of its charm.
4697,20200092,By the end; viewers have whiplash and a distinct sensation that the script needed several more drafts; but they aren't bored.
4698,20200092,A luminous and colorful indie with surprising amounts of realism. [Full Review in Spanish]
4699,20200092,The way Brie shows you Sarah slowly slipping out of reality-then steeply sliding further down a snake pit of instability-gives you the sense that she's flexing a new set of muscles.
4700,20200092,I found the experience of watching Horse Girl to be more of a chore than a pleasure.
4701,20200092,"Ostensibly; this is a tragedy about mental illness... But ""Horse Girl"" is far more subversive and playful than just that; allowing for Sarah's peculiar reality to envelope our own."
4702,20200092,Brie's performance is open and honest and disturbing and funny and lovely and resonant.
4703,20200092,Brie is rawly convincing as a troubled woman for whom the sides of reality have become too slippery; transformed into the heroine of a private sci-fi melodrama.
4704,20200092,Brie's performance is powerful and the film's editing does a superb job of mixing Sarah's obscured perception with reality; succeeding in offering an unsettling look into the mind of someone who suffers from a severe mental illness.
4705,20200093,Butt Boy isn't the worst film of 2020 - but it won't be far from the bottom.
4706,20200093,Believe it or not; Butt Boy isn't just a silly; ridiculous thriller about a man and his love of shoving things into his rear; it is; for lack of a better term; much deeper than that.
4707,20200093,I've never been happier for a filmmaker to just finally be so firmly up his own ass. Butt Boy can't really live up to the wildness of its premise; but it makes for entertaining viewing in its own right.
4708,20200093,"It may seem like a completely absurd; ""bad on purpose"" exploitation flick; but Butt Boy has some genuine pathos at its core."
4709,20200093,Instead of a gross-out gag fest; Butt Boy is a surprisingly tender bizarro comedy that works because it plays the strangeness straight.
4710,20200093,If you're like me; and you adore absurd cinema; then BUTT BOY is a must watch.
4711,20200093,You may not be able to believe what the one-of-a-kind detective-thriller/horror-satire Butt Boy is actually about - but [it might be] one of the best films of 2020. Seriously.
4712,20200093,The colonic tonic we've been waiting for.
4713,20200093,Writer-director Tyler Cornack and co-writer Ryan Koch have created a tale of fetishes and obsession; but draped it within a gumshoe driven mystery which is keenly aware of its campy roots.
4714,20200093,No one should be that desperate; so if your evening comes down to choosing between another film and this one; you should probably avoid this number two option.
4715,20200093,Butt Boy is not bizarre enough to embrace the weird and truly become the genuinely oddball film that I can recommend wholeheartedly.
4716,20200093,It touches on addiction; compulsion; career emptiness and; at its heart; loneliness...
4717,20200094,Nanjiani and Rae are the film's saving graces and certainly do quite a bit to keep us entertained; but in the end; the film's clashing genres rob it of any real stakes and make for a lackluster viewing experience.
4718,20200094,Showalter and a great cast deliver an oddball rom-com with offbeat charm.
4719,20200094,I'll take The Lovebirds as the representation progress it is; but I wish there was more to this than Rae's and Nanjiani's considerable-but not wholly redemptive-charm.
4720,20200094,Although the new film is an entirely different beast and may not be as good as its predecessor; The Lovebirds still manages to deliver a semi-good laugh; and a heartwarming love story.
4721,20200094,The film isn't nearly as elegant in driving these characters toward an enlightening conclusion; but it works out pretty simply: you'll probably like these characters; so you'll probably like this movie.
4722,20200094,It may be a goofy summer crime flick; but The Lovebirds is also about how no relationship is perfect; no matter how shiny it may look from the outside.
4723,20200094,This is a film designed to be watched while performing a menial task - folding the laundry or washing dishes.
4724,20200094,The Lovebirds might have underwhelmed in a movie theater but works just fine in the very different circumstances in which it has been unveiled.
4725,20200094,It is unlikely to be remembered as anything more than a diversionary lark. But it does stand as a testament to the ways in which the right actors can elevate even the most lackluster of material.
4726,20200094,It belongs in that category of movies each should ask to be left out of any career achievement retrospective montages awaiting them down the road.
4727,20200094,Fortunately; there's enough skill on display that The Lovebirds is still plenty enjoyable; as long as you don't think too hard about it.
4728,20200094,Issa Rae and Kumail Nanjiani display expert timing as the unhappy couple caught up a deadly criminal case.
4729,20200095,Alan Trezza's script indulges in trashy movie cliches while upending them; as dialog spins the story around. But a cheesy attempt to add a thematic slant never takes hold.
4730,20200095,The young actors are more than up to the task here; especially Daddario; whose 1970s-era Ivory Girl looks and pitch-perfect timing and facial expressions make her character a compelling ringleader for this fun and original slasher/romp
4731,20200095,'We Summon the Darkness' draws forth gory horror.
4732,20200095,Satantic panic horror will never go out of style; and this movie is filled with style. There's a lot to enjoy here for genre fans.
4733,20200095,Yeah; it's raunchy and campy; but there's nothing wrong with that. It's just as fun as it should be. [Full review in Spanish].
4734,20200095,Directed by Marc Meyers from a script by Alan Trezza; We Summon the Darkness starts in a familiar yet subversive fashion before drilling into its deeper themes exploring the fetishization of faith.
4735,20200095,An appealing cast and slick period production values make this an entertaining enough retro bloodbath.
4736,20200095,Not today; Satan. Not today.
4737,20200095,"""We Summon the Darkness"" is fine throughout..."
4738,20200095,It's like a good Blumhouse movie; told in elegantly framed images; and though the situation is extreme; the violent action is staged in a manner that one might describe as the understated version of over-the-top.
4739,20200095,The twist/reveal happens too early in the proceedings; bursting the mystery bubble and resulting in a long; drawn-out anticlimactic second-half that's disappointingly generic.
4740,20200095,The proceedings are not entirely unamusing in their lurid way; but they're also not nearly as clever as the filmmakers believed or hoped they would be.
4741,20200096,Ford is the best part of this version and the script is strong; but the overuse of CGI brought the production level down a few notches.
4742,20200096,...too calculated; too artificial; and too inorganic to find a true; beating heart.
4743,20200096,A kind adventure that puts fun above technical feat. [Full Review in Spanish]
4744,20200096,The Call of the Wild is better than expected; but still not fantastic. The poorly done CGI distracted from the story; which is actually good at it's core.
4745,20200096,If you can take your mind out off all the CGI extravaganza; The Call of The Wild becomes quite an enjoyable adventure with a strong performance from Harrison Ford.
4746,20200096,This artificial dog seems even more artificial because of its human-like intelligence and human-like facial expressions and movements. If this movie is the best adaptation of the book extant; and I don't know if it is; it is disappointing.
4747,20200096,The upshot is that this is an interesting one-star movie to think about. My son and I talked about it all afternoon. Whether it's a movie worth paying to see; however; is a different question.
4748,20200096,Harrison Ford does quietly powerful work as author Jack London's hero; but his computer-generated co-star looks weird.
4749,20200096,It's an unadventurous adventure.
4750,20200096,At a time where cynicism reigns; it's refreshing to call back to the simple thrills of venturing into the unknown -- CGI pups at your side or not.
4751,20200096,"There is little here; amid the high-tech photorealistic animations; that would satisfy London's concept of ""wild."""
4752,20200096,This film clocks in at a mere 100 minutes; but; except for a race between a dog sled and an avalanche; it lacks crispness as well as elan.
4753,20200097,"Pappas lights up ""Olympic Dreams;"" and has the star wattage to have a long movie career once she hangs up her running shoes."
4754,20200097,The plot is thin and light; feeling very improvisational at times.
4755,20200097,Though covering familiar rom/com territory; it does so pleasantly enough.
4756,20200097,Kroll is fine in his semi-dramatic turn as a romantically forlorn volunteer dentist; but Pappas is remarkable. She elicits a surprisingly tender performance.
4757,20200097,To navigate such a complex environment with a whole array of limitations and bureaucratic barriers is a complicated task; and Teicher manages to deliver a sweet tale of dreams and expectations. There is not much more than we can ask.
4758,20200097,Gorgeously shot and led by two ace performances; Olympic Dreams is the type of adult romantic comedy that simply does not get produced these days.
4759,20200097,Jeremy Teicher's offbeat charmer is an artful mix of documentary-style realism and wistful romanticism.
4760,20200097,It's almost painfully obvious that the film's dialogue was improvised during shooting; everyone constantly looks and sounds just a bit anxious; as if they're under significant pressure to come up with something interesting to say.
4761,20200097,"What if instead of the drama of athletes risking life; limb and loss for their countries; the Olympic Games set the scene for a run-of-the-mill romantic comedy? Such is the premise of ""Olympic Dreams."""
4762,20200097,"""Olympic Dreams"" is a wispy; quasi-romantic dramedy whose affecting moments are eclipsed by its overly random; sometimes awkwardly played and constructed narrative."
4763,20200097,The story of how Olympic Dreams got made is more compelling than the movie itself.
4764,20200097,"The engaging ""Olympic Dreams"" plays like ""Lost in Translation"" at the Winter Games."
4765,20200098,There are some valuable messages in Human Capital.
4766,20200098,Maya Hawke's work with Alex Wolf is what makes this worth watching.
4767,20200098,While it might hold one's attention; the slow-moving multi-family soap opera is disappointing in the end.
4768,20200098,"""Human Capital"" an expression of American class warfare. An amorality tale of the no-win situation for working-class people; when the wealthy throw money and superiority at the problem."
4769,20200098,At times too complicated for its own good; the screenplay juggles stories and perspectives as superb performances carry the day.
4770,20200098,the film's effectiveness is undermined at various points by some questionable plot developments that strain credulity
4771,20200098,"If you find hedge funds hard to wrap your head around; the movie ""Human Capital"" won't do much to ease the confusion."
4772,20200098,Frankly; the payoff to the movie's mystery is unsatisfying after all the buildup. None of these three stories really works as a short film on its own.
4773,20200098,Damned if Human Capital doesn't undermine and undervalue its actors even when it's giving them rock-solid material to play.
4774,20200098,I think the performances were great and the concept was solid. It was engrossing; but ultimately the resolution to mystery feels a little unsatisfying.
4775,20200098,The efficient writing and effective direction is a bit too swift to let some of the plot points fully land; and it's tied up with far too neat a bow for such an otherwise complicated story.
4776,20200098,[Though] it doesn't strike the nerve it should have; Human Capital features strong work from an exceptional cast; especially Schreiber; Tomei and Sarsgaard.
4777,20200099,Creates a lot of surreal imagery just with a low camera; creating space in a room or the woods around Gretel. She begins to fill the frame more and more as the camera gets closer; gradually changing the feeling of the scene.
4778,20200099,It will make you sleepy; without scaring you at all...
4779,20200099,Gretel's powers appear to come from the Force to such a degree that one can't help but wonder if she's related to the Skywalkers.
4780,20200099,And for all of the care that went into its look and its sound; the world of the film never feels more than halfway formed; in the rush to tie up its narrative loose ends; it leaves its more intriguing thematic ones hanging.
4781,20200099,"Essentially the story of a young woman coming into her power; ""Gretel & Hansel"" is quietly sinister; yet too underdeveloped to truly scare."
4782,20200099,While [Perkins] offers a stunning feast for the eyes; the substance is likely to leave viewers still hungry.
4783,20200099,"""Gretel & Hansel"" is as visually arresting as it is tedious; a 90-minute movie that really should have been a three-minute music video for Marilyn Manson or Ozzy Osbourne."
4784,20200099,It's got 'cult movie' written all over it [...] and audiences who tune into its unusual wavelength will no doubt be grateful for such a beautiful; frightening; intelligent new venture into an age-old nightmare.
4785,20200099,Fairy tales have rarely been so creepy on screen and this one; for once; does justice to the Grimm brothes' evil and dark vision. [Full review in Spanish]
4786,20200099,These tales are supposed to be creepy; full of dread and effective as this adaptation ends up being. It's an achievement of style and originality. [Full review in Spanish].
4787,20200099,Even at only 87 minutes the film feels stretched out; neither pushing its pungent ideas nor becoming properly scary.
4788,20200099,On the plus side; this has very striking production design and impressive cinematography... [But] it's bleak where it should be intense. It's stylish; but not very scary.
4789,20200100,"Funny, truthful and touching but never saccharine, this brilliantly cast family movie written by Lucy Alibar (Beasts of the Southern Wild) is one of the most delightful things streaming anywhere."
4790,20200100,"Cloying, very cutesy, and very exhausting."
4791,20200100,"As I was enjoying the sweet and simple and warmly funny pleasures of ""Troop Zero,"" I was thinking it had to be based on a popular Young Adult novel."
4792,20200100,"What we have here is a classic snobs-vs.-slobs type of standoff, an underdog tale slathered in Seventies Southern Gothic quirk."
4793,20200100,"There is a lot to admire in this movie about girls daring to be proudly, defiantly different, but it never lives up to its otherworldly promise."
4794,20200100,"A movie that's content to make do with whatever spare parts are lying around, and eventually does so more successfully than one might expect."
4795,20200100,"As boring as its wasted cast, Troop Zero fails to deliver a compeling and barely funny story. [Full review in Spanish]."
4796,20200100,"This is a touching film about inclusivity, children's need for adult supervision and interaction, forgiveness, and kindness."
4797,20200100,It's obvious the writer of the film had the ending first and awkwardly filled in the beginning. The first hour feels like three hours and what happened could have been condensed in ten minutes and still got the point across.
4798,20200100,"Troop Zero a great premise, but the results are underwhelming"
4799,20200100,"If you can excuse a bit of cinematic aimlessness at the beginning, you'll enjoy the story of star-struck Christmas Flint and her band of space explorers."
4800,20200100,"Put this movie in front of any girl, hell, any kid period, that's been demeaned about their differences or forced to conform to supposed societal standards."
